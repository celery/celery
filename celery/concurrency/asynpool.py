"""Version of multiprocessing.Pool using Async I/O.

.. note::

    This module will be moved soon, so don't use it directly.

This is a non-blocking version of :class:`multiprocessing.Pool`.

This code deals with three major challenges:

#. Starting up child processes and keeping them running.
#. Sending jobs to the processes and receiving results back.
#. Safely shutting down this system.
