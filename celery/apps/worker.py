    Registered for SIGQUIT and SIGINT (Ctrl+C) signals. If REMAP_SIGTERM is set to "SIGQUIT", this handler will also

    This handler will initiate the cold (and soft if enabled) shutdown procesdure for the worker.

    Worker running with N tasks:
        - SIGTERM:
            -The worker will initiate the warm shutdown process until all tasks are finished. Additional.
            SIGTERM signals will be ignored. SIGQUIT will transition to the cold shutdown process described below.
        - SIGQUIT:
            - The worker will initiate the cold shutdown process.
            - If the soft shutdown is enabled, the worker will wait for the tasks to finish up to the soft
            shutdown timeout (practically having a limited warm shutdown just before the cold shutdown).
            - Cancel all tasks (from the MainProcess) and allow the worker to complete the cold shutdown
            process gracefully.

    Caveats:
        - SIGINT (Ctrl+C) signal is defined to replace itself with the cold shutdown (SIGQUIT) after first use,
        and to emit a message to the user to hit Ctrl+C again to initiate the cold shutdown process. But, most
        important, it will also be caught in WorkController.start() to initiate the warm shutdown process.
        - SIGTERM will also be handled in WorkController.start() to initiate the warm shutdown process (the same).
        - If REMAP_SIGTERM is set to "SIGQUIT", the SIGTERM signal will be remapped to SIGQUIT, and the cold
        shutdown process will be initiated instead of the warm shutdown process using SIGTERM.
        - If SIGQUIT is received (also via SIGINT) during the cold/soft shutdown process, the handler will cancel all
        unacked requests but still wait for the soft shutdown process to finish before terminating the worker
        gracefully. The next time the signal is received though, the worker will terminate immediately by force.

    So, the purpose of this handler is to allow waiting for the soft shutdown timeout, then cancel all tasks from
    the MainProcess and let the WorkController.terminate() to terminate the worker naturally. If the soft shutdown
    is disabled, it will immediately cancel all tasks let the cold shutdown finish normally.
