"""Worker Remote Control Client.

Client for worker remote control commands.
Server implementation is in :mod:`celery.worker.control`.
There are two types of remote control commands:

* Inspect commands: Does not have side effects, will usually just return some value
  found in the worker, like the list of currently registered tasks, the list of active tasks, etc.
  Commands are accessible via :class:`Inspect` class.

* Control commands: Performs side effects, like adding a new queue to consume from.
  Commands are accessible via :class:`Control` class.
