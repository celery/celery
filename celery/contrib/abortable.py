"""Abortable Tasks.

Abortable tasks overview
=========================

For long-running :class:`Task`'s, it can be desirable to support
aborting during execution.  Of course, these tasks should be built to
support abortion specifically.

The :class:`AbortableTask` serves as a base class for all :class:`Task`
objects that should support abortion by producers.

* Producers may invoke the :meth:`abort` method on
  :class:`AbortableAsyncResult` instances, to request abortion.

* Consumers (workers) should periodically check (and honor!) the
  :meth:`is_aborted` method at controlled points in their task's
  :meth:`run` method.  The more often, the better.

The necessary intermediate communication is dealt with by the
:class:`AbortableTask` implementation.

Usage example
-------------

In the consumer:

.. code-block:: python

    from __future__ import absolute_import

    from celery.contrib.abortable import AbortableTask
    from celery.utils.log import get_task_logger

    from proj.celery import app

    logger = get_logger(__name__)

    @app.task(bind=True, base=AbortableTask)
    def long_running_task(self):
        results = []
        for i in range(100):
            # check after every 5 iterations...
            # (or alternatively, check when some timer is due)
            if not i % 5:
                if self.is_aborted():
                    # respect aborted state, and terminate gracefully.
                    logger.warning('Task aborted')
                    return
                value = do_something_expensive(i)
                results.append(y)
        logger.info('Task complete')
        return results

In the producer:

.. code-block:: python

    from __future__ import absolute_import

    import time

    from proj.tasks import MyLongRunningTask

    def myview(request):
        # result is of type AbortableAsyncResult
        result = long_running_task.delay()

        # abort the task after 10 seconds
        time.sleep(10)
        result.abort()

After the `result.abort()` call, the task execution isn't
aborted immediately.  In fact, it's not guaranteed to abort at all.
Keep checking `result.state` status, or call `result.get(timeout=)` to
have it block until the task is finished.

.. note::

   In order to abort tasks, there needs to be communication between the
   producer and the consumer.  This is currently implemented through the
   database backend.  Therefore, this class will only work with the
   database backends.

            task will be aborted (or even if the task will be aborted at all).
