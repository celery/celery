"""Recursive webcrawler example.

For asynchronous DNS lookups install the `dnspython` package:

    $ pip install dnspython

Requires the `pybloom` module for the bloom filter which is used
to ensure a lower chance of recrawling a URL previously seen.

Since the bloom filter is not shared, but only passed as an argument
to each subtask, it would be much better to have this as a centralized
service.  Redis sets could also be a practical solution.

A BloomFilter with a capacity of 100_000 members and an error rate
of 0.001 is 2.8MB pickled, but if compressed with zlib it only takes
up 2.9kB(!).

We don't have to do compression manually, just set the tasks compression
to "zlib", and the serializer to "pickle".
