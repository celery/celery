Celery Project Contributor Agreement
====================================

The submitter agrees by adding his or her name within the section below named
"Contributors" and submitting the resulting modified document to the
canonical shared repository location for this software project (whether
directly, as a user with "direct commit access", or via a "pull request"), he
or she is signing a contract electronically.  The submitter becomes a
Contributor after a) he or she signs this document by adding their name
beneath the "Contributors" section below, and b) the resulting document is
accepted into the canonical version control repository.

Treatment of Account
---------------------

Contributor will not allow anyone other than the Contributor to use his or
her username or source repository login to submit code to a Celery Project
source repository. Should Contributor become aware of any such use,
Contributor will immediately by notifying Ask Solem.
Notification must be performed by sending an email to
ask@celeryproject.org.  Until such notice is received, Contributor will be
presumed to have taken all actions made through Contributor's account. If the
Contributor has direct commit access, Ask Solem will have
complete control and discretion over capabilities assigned to Contributor's
account, and may disable Contributor's account for any reason at any time.

Legal Effect of Contribution
----------------------------

Upon submitting a change or new work to a Celery Project source Repository (a
"Contribution"), you agree to assign, and hereby do assign, a one-half
interest of all right, title and interest in and to copyright and other
intellectual property rights with respect to your new and original portions
of the Contribution to Ask Solem. You and Ask Solem
each agree that the other shall be free to exercise any and all exclusive
rights in and to the Contribution, without accounting to one another,
including without limitation, the right to license the Contribution to others
under the BSD License. This agreement shall run with title to the
Contribution. Ask Solem does not convey to you any right, title
or interest in or to the Program or such portions of the Contribution that
were taken from the Program. Your transmission of a submission to the Celery
Project source Repository and marks of identification concerning the
Contribution itself constitute your intent to contribute and your assignment
of the work in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

License Terms
-------------

Code committed to the Celery Project source repository (Committed Code) must
be governed by the BSD License
(http://www.opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)
or another license acceptable to Ask Solem.  Until
Ask Solem declares in writing an acceptable license other than
BSD, only the BSD shall be used.  A list of exceptions is detailed within
the "Licensing Exceptions" section of this document, if one exists.

Representations, Warranty, and Indemnification
----------------------------------------------

Contributor represents and warrants that the Committed Code does not violate
the rights of any person or entity, and that the Contributor has legal
authority to enter into this Agreement and legal authority over Contributed
Code. Further, Contributor indemnifies Ask Solem against violations.

Cryptography
------------

Contributor understands that cryptographic code may be subject to government
regulations with which Ask Solem and/or entities using Committed
Code must comply. Any code which contains any of the items listed below must
not be checked-in until Ask Solem has been notified and has
approved such contribution in writing.

- Cryptographic capabilities or features

- Calls to cryptographic features

- User interface elements which provide context relating to cryptography

- Code which may, under casual inspection, appear to be cryptographic.

Contributor confirms that any notices required will be included in any
Committed Code.
