You can install both Celery and these dependencies in one go using
either the `celery-with-redis`_, or the `django-celery-with-redis` bundles::

    $ pip install -U celery-with-redis

Configuration
=============

Configuration is easy, just configure the location of
your Redis database::

    BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'

Where the URL is in the format of::

    redis://userid:password@hostname:port/db_number

If you also want to store the state and return values of tasks in Redis,
you should configure these settings::
