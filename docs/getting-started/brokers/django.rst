===========================
 Using the Django Database
===========================

.. admonition:: Experimental Status

    The Django database transport is in need of improvements in many areas
    and there are several open bugs.  Unfortunately we don't have the resources or funds
    required to improve the situation, so we're looking for contributors
    and partners willing to help.

.. _broker-django-installation:

Installation
============

.. _broker-django-configuration:

Configuration
=============

The database transport uses the Django `DATABASE_*` settings for database
configuration values.

#. Set your broker transport::

    BROKER_URL = 'django://'

#. Add :mod:`kombu.transport.django` to `INSTALLED_APPS`::

    INSTALLED_APPS = ('kombu.transport.django',)

#. Sync your database schema:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python manage.py syncdb

.. _broker-django-limitations:

Limitations
===========

The Django database transport does not currently support:

    * Remote control commands (:program:`celery events` command, broadcast)
    * Events, including the Django Admin monitor.
    * Using more than a few workers (can lead to messages being executed
      multiple times).
