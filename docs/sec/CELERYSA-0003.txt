 CELERYSA-0003: Celery Security Advisory
=========================================
:contact: security@celeryproject.org
:CVE id: TBA
:date: 2016-12-08 05:00:00 p.m. PST

Details
=======

:package: celery
:vulnerability: Configuration Error
:problem type: remote
:risk: low
:versions-affected: 4.0.0

Description
===========

The default configuration in Celery 4.0.0 allowed for deserialization
of pickled messages, even if the software is configured to send
messages in the JSON format.

The particular configuration in question is the `accept_content` setting,
which by default was set to:

    app.conf.accept_content = ['json', 'pickle', 'msgpack', 'yaml']

The risk is still set to low considering that an attacker would require access
to the message broker used to send messages to Celery workers.

Systems affected
================

Users of Celery version 4.0.0 with no explicit accept_content setting set.

Solution
========

To work around the issue you can explicitly configure the accept_content
setting:

    app.conf.accept_content = ['json']

Or you can upgrade to the Celery 4.0.1 version:

    $ pip install -U celery

Distribution package maintainers are urged to provide their users
with updated packages.

Please direct questions to the celery-users mailing-list:
https://groups.google.com/group/celery-users/,

or if you're planning to report a new security related issue we request that
you keep the information confidential by contacting
security@celeryproject.org instead.

Thank you!
