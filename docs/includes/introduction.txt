Synopsis
========

Celery is an open source asynchronous task queue/job queue based on
distributed message passing.  It is focused on real-time operation,
but supports scheduling as well.

The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on one or
more worker nodes using multiprocessing, `Eventlet`_ or `gevent`_.  Tasks can
execute asynchronously (in the background) or synchronously
(wait until ready).

Celery is used in production systems to process millions of tasks a day.

Celery is written in Python, but the protocol can be implemented in any
language.  It can also `operate with other languages using webhooks`_.
There's also `RCelery` for the Ruby programming language, and a `PHP client`.

The recommended message broker is `RabbitMQ`_, but support for
`Redis`_, `MongoDB`_, `Beanstalk`_, `Amazon SQS`_, `CouchDB`_ and
databases (using `SQLAlchemy`_ or the `Django ORM`_) is also available.

Celery is easy to integrate with web frameworks, some of which even have
integration packages:

.. _celery-overview:

Overview
========

This is a high level overview of the architecture.

.. image:: http://cloud.github.com/downloads/ask/celery/Celery-Overview-v4.jpg

The broker delivers tasks to the worker nodes.
A worker node is a networked machine running `celeryd`.  This can be one or
more machines depending on the workload.

The result of the task can be stored for later retrieval (called its
"tombstone").

.. _celery-example:

Example
=======

You probably want to see some code by now, so here's an example task
adding two numbers:

.. code-block:: python

    from celery.task import task

    @task
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

You can execute the task in the background, or wait for it to finish::

    >>> result = add.delay(4, 4)
    >>> result.wait() # wait for and return the result
    8

Simple!

.. _celery-features:

Features
========

    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Messaging       | Supported brokers include `RabbitMQ`_, `Redis`_,   |
    |                 | `Beanstalk`_, `MongoDB`_, `CouchDB`_, and popular  |
    |                 | SQL databases.                                     |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Fault-tolerant  | Excellent configurable error recovery when using   |
    |                 | `RabbitMQ`, ensures your tasks are never lost.     |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Distributed     | Runs on one or more machines. Supports             |
    |                 | broker `clustering`_ and `HA`_ when used in        |
    |                 | combination with `RabbitMQ`_.  You can set up new  |
    |                 | workers without central configuration (e.g. use    |
    |                 | your grandma's laptop to help if the queue is      |
    |                 | temporarily congested).                            |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Concurrency     | Concurrency is achieved by using multiprocessing,  |
    |                 | `Eventlet`_, `gevent` or a mix of these.           |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Scheduling      | Supports recurring tasks like cron, or specifying  |
    |                 | an exact date or countdown for when after the task |
    |                 | should be executed.                                |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Latency         | Low latency means you are able to execute tasks    |
    |                 | *while the user is waiting*.                       |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Return Values   | Task return values can be saved to the selected    |
    |                 | result store backend. You can wait for the result, |
    |                 | retrieve it later, or ignore it.                   |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Result Stores   | Database, `MongoDB`_, `Redis`_, `Tokyo Tyrant`,    |
    |                 | `Cassandra`, or `AMQP`_ (message notification).    |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Webhooks        | Your tasks can also be HTTP callbacks, enabling    |
    |                 | cross-language communication.                      |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Rate limiting   | Supports rate limiting by using the token bucket   |
    |                 | algorithm, which accounts for bursts of traffic.   |
    |                 | Rate limits can be set for each task type, or      |
    |                 | globally for all.                                  |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Routing         | Using AMQP's flexible routing model you can route  |
    |                 | tasks to different workers, or select different    |
    |                 | message topologies, by configuration or even at    |
    |                 | runtime.                                           |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Remote-control  | Worker nodes can be controlled from remote by      |
    |                 | using broadcast messaging.  A range of built-in    |
    |                 | commands exist in addition to the ability to       |
    |                 | easily define your own. (AMQP/Redis only)          |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Monitoring      | You can capture everything happening with the      |
    |                 | workers in real-time by subscribing to events.     |
    |                 | A real-time web monitor is in development.         |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Serialization   | Supports Pickle, JSON, YAML, or easily defined     |
    |                 | custom schemes. One task invocation can have a     |
    |                 | different scheme than another.                     |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Tracebacks      | Errors and tracebacks are stored and can be        |
    |                 | investigated after the fact.                       |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | UUID            | Every task has an UUID (Universally Unique         |
    |                 | Identifier), which is the task id used to query    |
    |                 | task status and return value.                      |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Retries         | Tasks can be retried if they fail, with            |
    |                 | configurable maximum number of retries, and delays |
    |                 | between each retry.                                |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Task Sets       | A Task set is a task consisting of several         |
    |                 | sub-tasks. You can find out how many, or if all    |
    |                 | of the sub-tasks has been executed, and even       |
    |                 | retrieve the results in order. Progress bars,      |
    |                 | anyone?                                            |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Made for Web    | You can query status and results via URLs,         |
    |                 | enabling the ability to poll task status using     |
    |                 | Ajax.                                              |
    +-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Error Emails    | Can be configured to send emails to the            |
    |                 | administrators when tasks fails.                   |
