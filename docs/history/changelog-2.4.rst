2.4.5
=====
:release-date: 2011-12-02 05:00 P.M GMT
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Periodic task interval schedules were accidentally rounded down,
  resulting in some periodic tasks being executed early.

* Logging of humanized times in the beat log is now more detailed.

* New :ref:`brokers` section in the Getting Started part of the Documentation

    This replaces the old "Other queues" tutorial, and adds
    documentation for MongoDB, Beanstalk and CouchDB.

Security Fixes
--------------

* [Security: `CELERYSA-0001`_] Daemons would set effective id's rather than
  real id's when the :option:`--uid`/:option:`--gid` arguments to
  :program:`celery multi`, :program:`celeryd_detach`,
  :program:`celery beat` and :program:`celery events` were used.

  This means privileges weren't properly dropped, and that it would
  be possible to regain supervisor privileges later.

Fixes
-----

* Processes pool: Fixed rare deadlock at shutdown (Issue #523).

    Fix contributed by Ionel Maries Christian.

* Webhook tasks issued the wrong HTTP POST headers (Issue #515).

    The *Content-Type* header has been changed from
    ``application/json`` â‡’  ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded``,
    and adds a proper *Content-Length* header.

    Fix contributed by Mitar.

* Daemonization tutorial: Adds a configuration example using Django and
  virtualenv together (Issue #505).

    Contributed by Juan Ignacio Catalano.

* generic init scripts now automatically creates log and pid file
  directories (Issue #545).

    Contributed by Chris Streeter.

2.4.2
=====
:release-date: 2011-11-14 12:00 P.M GMT
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Program module no longer uses relative imports so that it is
  possible to do ``python -m celery.bin.name``.

.. _version-2.4.1:

2.4.1

* processes pool: MaybeEncodingError was not wrapped in ExceptionInfo
  (Issue #524).

* worker: would silence errors occuring after task consumer started.

* logging: Fixed a bug where unicode in stdout redirected log messages
  couldn't be written (Issue #522).

.. _version-2.4.0:

2.4.0
=====
:release-date: 2011-11-04 04:00 P.M GMT

.. _v240-important:

Important Notes
---------------

* Now supports Python 3.

* Fixed deadlock in worker process handling (Issue #496).

    A deadlock could occur after spawning new child processes because
    the logging library's mutex was not properly reset after fork.

    The symptoms of this bug affecting would be that the worker simply
    stops processing tasks, as none of the workers child processes
    are functioning.  There was a greater chance of this bug occurring
    with ``maxtasksperchild`` or a time-limit enabled.

    This is a workaround for http://bugs.python.org/issue6721#msg140215.

    Be aware that while this fixes the logging library lock,
    there could still be other locks initialized in the parent
    process, introduced by custom code.

    Fix contributed by Harm Verhagen.

* AMQP Result backend: Now expires results by default.

    The default expiration value is now taken from the
    :setting:`CELERY_TASK_RESULT_EXPIRES` setting.

    The old :setting:`CELERY_AMQP_TASK_RESULT_EXPIRES` setting has been
    deprecated and will be removed in version 4.0.

    Note that this means that the result backend requires RabbitMQ 2.1.0 or
    higher, and that you have to disable expiration if you are running
    with an older version.  You can do so by disabling the
    :setting:`CELERY_TASK_RESULT_EXPIRES` setting::

        CELERY_TASK_RESULT_EXPIRES = None

* Eventlet: Fixed problem with shutdown (Issue #457).

* Broker transports can be now be specified using URLs

    The broker can now be specified as an URL instead.
    This URL must have the format::

        transport://user:password@hostname:port/virtual_host

    for example the default broker is written as::

        amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//

    The scheme is required, so that the host is identified
    as an URL and not just a host name.
    User, password, port and virtual_host are optional and
    defaults to the particular transports default value.

    .. note::

        Note that the path component (virtual_host) always starts with a
        forward-slash.  This is necessary to distinguish between the virtual
        host ``''`` (empty) and ``'/'``, which are both acceptable virtual
        host names.

        A virtual host of ``'/'`` becomes:

            amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//

        and a virtual host of ``''`` (empty) becomes::

            amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/

        So the leading slash in the path component is **always required**.

    In addition the :setting:`BROKER_URL` setting has been added as an alias
    to ``BROKER_HOST``.  Any broker setting specified in both the URL and in
    the configuration will be ignored, if a setting is not provided in the URL
    then the value from the configuration will be used as default.

    Also, programs now support the :option:`-b|--broker` option to specify
    a broker URL on the command-line:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ celery worker -b redis://localhost

        $ celery inspect -b amqp://guest:guest@localhost//e

    The environment variable :envvar:`CELERY_BROKER_URL` can also be used to
    easily override the default broker used.

* The deprecated :func:`celery.loaders.setup_loader` function has been removed.

* The :setting:`CELERY_TASK_ERROR_WHITELIST` setting has been replaced
  by a more flexible approach (Issue #447).

    The error mail sending logic is now available as ``Task.ErrorMail``,
    with the implementation (for reference) in :mod:`celery.utils.mail`.

    The error mail class can be sub-classed to gain complete control
    of when error messages are sent, thus removing the need for a separate
    white-list setting.

    The :setting:`CELERY_TASK_ERROR_WHITELIST` setting has been deprecated,
    and will be removed completely in version 4.0.

* Additional Deprecations

    The following functions has been deprecated and is scheduled for removal in
    version 4.0:

    =====================================  ===================================
    **Old function**                       **Alternative**

    `celery.execute.apply_async`           `Task.apply_async`
    `celery.execute.delay_task`            `celery.execute.send_task`

.. _v240-news:

News
----

* No longer depends on :mod:`pyparsing`.

* Now depends on Kombu 1.4.3.

* CELERY_IMPORTS can now be a scalar value (Issue #485).

    It is too easy to forget to add the comma after the sole element of a
    tuple, and this is something that often affects newcomers.

    The docs should probably use a list in examples, as using a tuple
    for this doesn't even make sense.  Nonetheless, there are many
    tutorials out there using a tuple, and this change should be a help
    to new users.

    Suggested by jsaxon-cars.

* Fixed a memory leak when using the thread pool (Issue #486).

    Contributed by Kornelijus Survila.

* The statedb was not saved at exit.

    This has now been fixed and it should again remember previously
    revoked tasks when a ``--statedb`` is enabled.

* Adds :setting:`EMAIL_USE_TLS` to enable secure SMTP connections
  (Issue #418).

    Contributed by Stefan Kjartansson.

* Now handles missing fields in task messages as documented in the message
  format documentation.

    * Missing required field throws :exc:`~@InvalidTaskError`
    * Missing args/kwargs is assumed empty.

    Contributed by Chris Chamberlin.

* Fixed race condition in celery.events.state (celerymon/celeryev)
  where task info would be removed while iterating over it (Issue #501).

* The Cache, Cassandra, MongoDB, Redis and Tyrant backends now respects
  the :setting:`CELERY_RESULT_SERIALIZER` setting (Issue #435).

    This means that only the database (django/sqlalchemy) backends
    currently does not support using custom serializers.

    Contributed by Steeve Morin

* Logging calls no longer manually formats messages, but delegates
  that to the logging system, so tools like Sentry can easier
  work with the messages (Issue #445).

    Contributed by Chris Adams.

* ``multi`` now supports a ``stop_verify`` command to wait for
  processes to shutdown.

* Cache backend did not work if the cache key was unicode (Issue #504).

    Fix contributed by Neil Chintomby.

* New setting :setting:`CELERY_RESULT_DB_SHORT_LIVED_SESSIONS` added,
  which if enabled will disable the caching of SQLAlchemy sessions
  (Issue #449).

    Contributed by Leo Dirac.

* All result backends now implements ``__reduce__`` so that they can
  be pickled (Issue #441).

    Fix contributed by Remy Noel

* multi did not work on Windows (Issue #472).

* New-style ``CELERY_REDIS_*`` settings now takes precedence over
  the old ``REDIS_*`` configuration keys (Issue #508).

    Fix contributed by Joshua Ginsberg

* Generic beat init script no longer sets `bash -e` (Issue #510).

    Fix contributed by Roger Hu.

* Documented that Chords do not work well with redis-server versions
  before 2.2.

    Contributed by Dan McGee.

* The :setting:`CELERYBEAT_MAX_LOOP_INTERVAL` setting was not respected.

* ``inspect.registered_tasks`` renamed to ``inspect.registered`` for naming
  consistency.

    The previous name is still available as an alias.

    Contributed by Mher Movsisyan

* Worker logged the string representation of args and kwargs
  without safe guards (Issue #480).

* RHEL init script: Changed worker startup priority.

    The default start / stop priorities for MySQL on RHEL are

        # chkconfig: - 64 36

    Therefore, if Celery is using a database as a broker / message store, it
    should be started after the database is up and running, otherwise errors
    will ensue. This commit changes the priority in the init script to

        # chkconfig: - 85 15

    which are the default recommended settings for 3-rd party applications
    and assure that Celery will be started after the database service & shut
    down before it terminates.

    Contributed by Yury V. Zaytsev.

* KeyValueStoreBackend.get_many did not respect the ``timeout`` argument
  (Issue #512).

* beat/events's --workdir option did not chdir before after
  configuration was attempted (Issue #506).

* After deprecating 2.4 support we can now name modules correctly, since we
  can take use of absolute imports.

    Therefore the following internal modules have been renamed:

        celery.concurrency.evlet    -> celery.concurrency.eventlet
        celery.concurrency.evg      -> celery.concurrency.gevent

* AUTHORS file is now sorted alphabetically.

    Also, as you may have noticed the contributors of new features/fixes are
    now mentioned in the Changelog.
