This document contains change notes for bugfix & new features
in the & 5.1.x series, please see :ref:`whatsnew-5.1` for

.. version-5.1.2:

5.1.2
=====
:release-date: 2021-06-28 16.15 P.M UTC+3:00
:release-by: Omer Katz

- When chords fail, correctly call errbacks. (#6814)

    We had a special case for calling errbacks when a chord failed which
    assumed they were old style. This change ensures that we call the proper
    errback dispatch method which understands new and old style errbacks,
    and adds test to confirm that things behave as one might expect now.
- Avoid using the ``Event.isSet()`` deprecated alias. (#6824)
- Reintroduce sys.argv default behaviour for ``Celery.start()``. (#6825)
