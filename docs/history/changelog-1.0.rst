1.0.6
=====
:release-date: 2010-06-30 09:57 A.M CEST
:release-by: Ask Solem

* RabbitMQ 1.8.0 has extended their exchange equivalence tests to
  include `auto_delete` and `durable`. This broke the AMQP backend.

  If you've already used the AMQP backend this means you have to
  delete the previous definitions:

  .. code-block:: console

      $ camqadm exchange.delete celeryresults

  or:

  .. code-block:: console

      $ python manage.py camqadm exchange.delete celeryresults

.. _version-1.0.5:

1.0.5
=====
:release-date: 2010-06-01 02:36 P.M CEST
:release-by: Ask Solem

.. _v105-critical:

Critical
--------

* SIGINT/Ctrl+C killed the pool, abruptly terminating the currently executing
  tasks.

    Fixed by making the pool worker processes ignore :const:`SIGINT`.

* Should not close the consumers before the pool is terminated, just cancel
  the consumers.

    See issue #122.

* Now depends on :mod:`billiard` >= 0.3.1

* worker: Previously exceptions raised by worker components could stall startup,
  now it correctly logs the exceptions and shuts down.

* worker: Prefetch counts was set too late. QoS is now set as early as possible,
  so the worker: can't slurp in all the messages at start-up.

.. _v105-changes:

Changes
-------

* :mod:`celery.contrib.abortable`: Abortable tasks.

    Tasks that defines steps of execution, the task can then
    be aborted after each step has completed.

* :class:`~celery.events.EventDispatcher`: No longer creates AMQP channel
  if events are disabled

* Added required RPM package names under `[bdist_rpm]` section, to support building RPMs
  from the sources using setup.py

* Running unit tests: :envvar:`NOSE_VERBOSE` environment var now enables verbose output from Nose.

* :func:`celery.execute.apply`: Pass log file/log level arguments as task kwargs.

    See issue #110.

* celery.execute.apply: Should return exception, not :class:`~celery.datastructures.ExceptionInfo`
  on error.

    See issue #111.

* Added new entries to the :ref:`FAQs <faq>`:

    * Should I use retry or acks_late?
    * Can I call a task by name?

.. _version-1.0.4:

1.0.4
=====
:release-date: 2010-05-31 09:54 A.M CEST
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Changelog merged with 1.0.5 as the release was never announced.

.. _version-1.0.3:

1.0.3
=====
:release-date: 2010-05-15 03:00 P.M CEST
:release-by: Ask Solem

.. _v103-important:

Important notes
---------------

* Messages are now acknowledged *just before* the task function is executed.

    This is the behavior we've wanted all along, but couldn't have because of
    limitations in the multiprocessing module.
    The previous behavior was not good, and the situation worsened with the
    release of 1.0.1, so this change will definitely improve
    reliability, performance and operations in general.

    For more information please see http://bit.ly/9hom6T

* Database result backend: result now explicitly sets `null=True` as
  `django-picklefield` version 0.1.5 changed the default behavior
  right under our noses :(

    See: http://bit.ly/d5OwMr

    This means those who created their celery tables (via syncdb or
    celeryinit) with picklefield versions >= 0.1.5 has to alter their tables to
    allow the result field to be `NULL` manually.

    MySQL::

        ALTER TABLE celery_taskmeta MODIFY result TEXT NULL

    PostgreSQL::

        ALTER TABLE celery_taskmeta ALTER COLUMN result DROP NOT NULL

* Removed `Task.rate_limit_queue_type`, as it was not really useful
  and made it harder to refactor some parts.

* Now depends on carrot >= 0.10.4

* Now depends on billiard >= 0.3.0

.. _v103-news:

News
----

* AMQP backend: Added timeout support for `result.get()` /
  `result.wait()`.

* New task option: `Task.acks_late` (default: :setting:`CELERY_ACKS_LATE`)

    Late ack means the task messages will be acknowledged **after** the task
    has been executed, not *just before*, which is the default behavior.

    .. note::

        This means the tasks may be executed twice if the worker
        crashes in mid-execution. Not acceptable for most
        applications, but desirable for others.

* Added crontab-like scheduling to periodic tasks.

    Like a cron job, you can specify units of time of when
    you would like the task to execute. While not a full implementation
    of cron's features, it should provide a fair degree of common scheduling
    needs.

    You can specify a minute (0-59), an hour (0-23), and/or a day of the
    week (0-6 where 0 is Sunday, or by names: sun, mon, tue, wed, thu, fri,
    sat).

    Examples:

    .. code-block:: python

        from celery.schedules import crontab
        from celery.decorators import periodic_task

        @periodic_task(run_every=crontab(hour=7, minute=30))
        def every_morning():
            print("Runs every morning at 7:30a.m")

        @periodic_task(run_every=crontab(hour=7, minute=30, day_of_week="mon"))
        def every_monday_morning():
            print("Run every monday morning at 7:30a.m")

        @periodic_task(run_every=crontab(minutes=30))
        def every_hour():
            print("Runs every hour on the clock. e.g. 1:30, 2:30, 3:30 etc.")

    .. note::
        This a late addition. While we have unittests, due to the
        nature of this feature we haven't been able to completely test this
        in practice, so consider this experimental.

* `TaskPool.apply_async`: Now supports the `accept_callback` argument.

* `apply_async`: Now raises :exc:`ValueError` if task args is not a list,
  or kwargs is not a tuple (Issue #95).

* `Task.max_retries` can now be `None`, which means it will retry forever.

* Celerybeat: Now reuses the same connection when publishing large
  sets of tasks.

* Modified the task locking example in the documentation to use
  `cache.add` for atomic locking.

* Added experimental support for a *started* status on tasks.

    If `Task.track_started` is enabled the task will report its status
    as "started" when the task is executed by a worker.

    The default value is `False` as the normal behaviour is to not
    report that level of granularity. Tasks are either pending, finished,
    or waiting to be retried. Having a "started" status can be useful for
    when there are long running tasks and there is a need to report which
    task is currently running.

    The global default can be overridden by the :setting:`CELERY_TRACK_STARTED`
    setting.

* User Guide: New section `Tips and Best Practices`.

    Contributions welcome!

.. _v103-remote-control:

Remote control commands
-----------------------

* Remote control commands can now send replies back to the caller.

    Existing commands has been improved to send replies, and the client
    interface in `celery.task.control` has new keyword arguments: `reply`,
    `timeout` and `limit`. Where reply means it will wait for replies,
    timeout is the time in seconds to stop waiting for replies, and limit
    is the maximum number of replies to get.

    By default, it will wait for as many replies as possible for one second.

    * rate_limit(task_name, destination=all, reply=False, timeout=1, limit=0)

        Worker returns `{"ok": message}` on success,
        or `{"failure": message}` on failure.

            >>> from celery.task.control import rate_limit
            >>> rate_limit("tasks.add", "10/s", reply=True)
            [{'worker1': {'ok': 'new rate limit set successfully'}},
             {'worker2': {'ok': 'new rate limit set successfully'}}]

    * ping(destination=all, reply=False, timeout=1, limit=0)

        Worker returns the simple message `"pong"`.

            >>> from celery.task.control import ping
            >>> ping(reply=True)
            [{'worker1': 'pong'},
             {'worker2': 'pong'},

    * revoke(destination=all, reply=False, timeout=1, limit=0)

        Worker simply returns `True`.

            >>> from celery.task.control import revoke
            >>> revoke("419e46eb-cf6a-4271-86a8-442b7124132c", reply=True)
            [{'worker1': True},
             {'worker2'; True}]

* You can now add your own remote control commands!

    Remote control commands are functions registered in the command
    registry. Registering a command is done using
    :meth:`celery.worker.control.Panel.register`:

    .. code-block:: python

        from celery.task.control import Panel

        @Panel.register
        def reset_broker_connection(state, **kwargs):
            state.consumer.reset_connection()
            return {"ok": "connection re-established"}

    With this module imported in the worker, you can launch the command
    using `celery.task.control.broadcast`::

        >>> from celery.task.control import broadcast
        >>> broadcast("reset_broker_connection", reply=True)
        [{'worker1': {'ok': 'connection re-established'},
         {'worker2': {'ok': 'connection re-established'}}]

    **TIP** You can choose the worker(s) to receive the command
    by using the `destination` argument::

        >>> broadcast("reset_broker_connection", destination=["worker1"])
        [{'worker1': {'ok': 'connection re-established'}]

* New remote control command: `dump_reserved`

    Dumps tasks reserved by the worker, waiting to be executed::

        >>> from celery.task.control import broadcast
        >>> broadcast("dump_reserved", reply=True)
        [{'myworker1': [<TaskRequest ....>]}]

* New remote control command: `dump_schedule`

    Dumps the workers currently registered ETA schedule.
    These are tasks with an `eta` (or `countdown`) argument
    waiting to be executed by the worker.

        >>> from celery.task.control import broadcast
        >>> broadcast("dump_schedule", reply=True)
        [{'w1': []},
         {'w3': []},
         {'w2': ['0. 2010-05-12 11:06:00 pri0 <TaskRequest
                    {name:"opalfeeds.tasks.refresh_feed_slice",
                     id:"95b45760-4e73-4ce8-8eac-f100aa80273a",
                     args:"(<Feeds freq_max:3600 freq_min:60
                                   start:2184.0 stop:3276.0>,)",
                     kwargs:"{'page': 2}"}>']},
         {'w4': ['0. 2010-05-12 11:00:00 pri0 <TaskRequest
                    {name:"opalfeeds.tasks.refresh_feed_slice",
                     id:"c053480b-58fb-422f-ae68-8d30a464edfe",
                     args:"(<Feeds freq_max:3600 freq_min:60
                                   start:1092.0 stop:2184.0>,)",
                     kwargs:"{\'page\': 1}"}>',
                '1. 2010-05-12 11:12:00 pri0 <TaskRequest
                    {name:"opalfeeds.tasks.refresh_feed_slice",

                     args:"(<Feeds freq_max:3600 freq_min:60
                                   start:3276.0 stop:4365>,)",
                     kwargs:"{\'page\': 3}"}>']}]

.. _v103-fixes:

Fixes
-----

* Mediator thread no longer blocks for more than 1 second.

    With rate limits enabled and when there was a lot of remaining time,
    the mediator thread could block shutdown (and potentially block other
    jobs from coming in).

* Remote rate limits was not properly applied (Issue #98).

* Now handles exceptions with Unicode messages correctly in
  `TaskRequest.on_failure`.

* Database backend: `TaskMeta.result`: default value should be `None`
  not empty string.

.. _version-1.0.2:

1.0.2
=====
:release-date: 2010-03-31 12:50 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Deprecated: :setting:`CELERY_BACKEND`, please use
  :setting:`CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` instead.

* We now use a custom logger in tasks. This logger supports task magic
  keyword arguments in formats.

    The default format for tasks (:setting:`CELERYD_TASK_LOG_FORMAT`) now
    includes the id and the name of tasks so the origin of task log messages
    can easily be traced.

    Example output::
        [2010-03-25 13:11:20,317: INFO/PoolWorker-1]
            [tasks.add(a6e1c5ad-60d9-42a0-8b24-9e39363125a4)] Hello from add

    To revert to the previous behavior you can set::

        CELERYD_TASK_LOG_FORMAT = """
            [%(asctime)s: %(levelname)s/%(processName)s] %(message)s
        """.strip()

* Unit tests: Don't disable the django test database tear down,
  instead fixed the underlying issue which was caused by modifications
  to the `DATABASE_NAME` setting (Issue #82).

* Django Loader: New config :setting:`CELERY_DB_REUSE_MAX` (max number of
  tasks to reuse the same database connection)

    The default is to use a new connection for every task.
    We would very much like to reuse the connection, but a safe number of
    reuses is not known, and we don't have any way to handle the errors
    that might happen, which may even be database dependent.

    See: http://bit.ly/94fwdd

* worker: The worker components are now configurable: :setting:`CELERYD_POOL`,
  :setting:`CELERYD_CONSUMER`, :setting:`CELERYD_MEDIATOR`, and
  :setting:`CELERYD_ETA_SCHEDULER`.

    The default configuration is as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        CELERYD_POOL = "celery.concurrency.processes.TaskPool"
        CELERYD_MEDIATOR = "celery.worker.controllers.Mediator"
        CELERYD_ETA_SCHEDULER = "celery.worker.controllers.ScheduleController"
        CELERYD_CONSUMER = "celery.worker.consumer.Consumer"

    The :setting:`CELERYD_POOL` setting makes it easy to swap out the
    multiprocessing pool with a threaded pool, or how about a
    twisted/eventlet pool?

    Consider the competition for the first pool plug-in started!


* Debian init scripts: Use `-a` not `&&` (Issue #82).

* Debian init scripts: Now always preserves `$CELERYD_OPTS` from the
  `/etc/default/celeryd` and `/etc/default/celerybeat`.

* celery.beat.Scheduler: Fixed a bug where the schedule was not properly
  flushed to disk if the schedule had not been properly initialized.

* celerybeat: Now syncs the schedule to disk when receiving the :sig:`SIGTERM`
  and :sig:`SIGINT` signals.

* Control commands: Make sure keywords arguments are not in Unicode.

* ETA scheduler: Was missing a logger object, so the scheduler crashed
  when trying to log that a task had been revoked.

* management.commands.camqadm: Fixed typo `camqpadm` -> `camqadm`
  (Issue #83).

* PeriodicTask.delta_resolution: Was not working for days and hours, now fixed
  by rounding to the nearest day/hour.

* Fixed a potential infinite loop in `BaseAsyncResult.__eq__`, although
  there is no evidence that it has ever been triggered.

* worker: Now handles messages with encoding problems by acking them and
  emitting an error message.

.. _version-1.0.1:

1.0.1
=====
:release-date: 2010-02-24 07:05 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Tasks are now acknowledged early instead of late.

    This is done because messages can only be acknowledged within the same
    connection channel, so if the connection is lost we would have to refetch
    the message again to acknowledge it.

    This might or might not affect you, but mostly those running tasks with a
    really long execution time are affected, as all tasks that has made it
    all the way into the pool needs to be executed before the worker can
    safely terminate (this is at most the number of pool workers, multiplied
    by the :setting:`CELERYD_PREFETCH_MULTIPLIER` setting.)

    We multiply the prefetch count by default to increase the performance at
    times with bursts of tasks with a short execution time. If this doesn't
    apply to your use case, you should be able to set the prefetch multiplier
    to zero, without sacrificing performance.

    .. note::

        A patch to :mod:`multiprocessing` is currently being
        worked on, this patch would enable us to use a better solution, and is
        scheduled for inclusion in the `2.0.0` release.

* The worker now shutdowns cleanly when receiving the :sig:`SIGTERM` signal.

* The worker now does a cold shutdown if the :sig:`SIGINT` signal
  is received (Ctrl+C),
  this means it tries to terminate as soon as possible.

* Caching of results now moved to the base backend classes, so no need
  to implement this functionality in the base classes.

* Caches are now also limited in size, so their memory usage doesn't grow
  out of control.

    You can set the maximum number of results the cache
    can hold using the :setting:`CELERY_MAX_CACHED_RESULTS` setting (the
    default is five thousand results). In addition, you can refetch already
    retrieved results using `backend.reload_task_result` +
    `backend.reload_taskset_result` (that's for those who want to send
    results incrementally).

* The worker now works on Windows again.

    .. warning::

        If you're using Celery with Django, you can't use `project.settings`
        as the settings module name, but the following should work:

        .. code-block:: console

            $ python manage.py celeryd --settings=settings

* Execution: `.messaging.TaskPublisher.send_task` now
  incorporates all the functionality apply_async previously did.

    Like converting countdowns to eta, so :func:`celery.execute.apply_async` is
    now simply a convenient front-end to
    :meth:`celery.messaging.TaskPublisher.send_task`, using
    the task classes default options.

    Also :func:`celery.execute.send_task` has been
    introduced, which can apply tasks using just the task name (useful
    if the client does not have the destination task in its task registry).

    Example:

        >>> from celery.execute import send_task
        >>> result = send_task("celery.ping", args=[], kwargs={})
        >>> result.get()
        'pong'

* `camqadm`: This is a new utility for command-line access to the AMQP API.

    Excellent for deleting queues/bindings/exchanges, experimentation and
    testing:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ camqadm
        1> help

    Gives an interactive shell, type `help` for a list of commands.

    When using Django, use the management command instead:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ python manage.py camqadm
        1> help

* Redis result backend: To conform to recent Redis API changes, the following
  settings has been deprecated:

        * `REDIS_TIMEOUT`
        * `REDIS_CONNECT_RETRY`

    These will emit a `DeprecationWarning` if used.

    A `REDIS_PASSWORD` setting has been added, so you can use the new
    simple authentication mechanism in Redis.

* The redis result backend no longer calls `SAVE` when disconnecting,
  as this is apparently better handled by Redis itself.

* If `settings.DEBUG` is on, the worker now warns about the possible
  memory leak it can result in.

* The ETA scheduler now sleeps at most two seconds between iterations.

* The ETA scheduler now deletes any revoked tasks it might encounter.

    As revokes are not yet persistent, this is done to make sure the task
    is revoked even though it's currently being hold because its eta is e.g.
    a week into the future.

* The `task_id` argument is now respected even if the task is executed
  eagerly (either using apply, or :setting:`CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER`).

* The internal queues are now cleared if the connection is reset.

* New magic keyword argument: `delivery_info`.

    Used by retry() to resend the task to its original destination using the same
    exchange/routing_key.

* Events: Fields was not passed by `.send()` (fixes the UUID key errors
  in celerymon)

* Added `--schedule`/`-s` option to the worker, so it is possible to
  specify a custom schedule filename when using an embedded celerybeat
  server (the `-B`/`--beat`) option.

* Better Python 2.4 compatibility. The test suite now passes.

* task decorators: Now preserve docstring as `cls.__doc__`, (was previously
  copied to `cls.run.__doc__`)

* The `testproj` directory has been renamed to `tests` and we're now using
  `nose` + `django-nose` for test discovery, and `unittest2` for test
  cases.

* New pip requirements files available in :file:`requirements`.

* TaskPublisher: Declarations are now done once (per process).

* Added `Task.delivery_mode` and the :setting:`CELERY_DEFAULT_DELIVERY_MODE`
  setting.

    These can be used to mark messages non-persistent (i.e. so they are
    lost if the broker is restarted).

* Now have our own `ImproperlyConfigured` exception, instead of using the
  Django one.

* Improvements to the Debian init scripts: Shows an error if the program is
  not executable.  Does not modify `CELERYD` when using django with
  virtualenv.

.. _v100-incompatible:

Backward incompatible changes
-----------------------------

* Celery does not support detaching anymore, so you have to use the tools
  available on your platform, or something like Supervisord to make
  celeryd/celerybeat/celerymon into background processes.

    We've had too many problems with the worker daemonizing itself, so it was
    decided it has to be removed. Example startup scripts has been added to
    the `extra/` directory:

    * Debian, Ubuntu, (start-stop-daemon)

        `extra/debian/init.d/celeryd`
        `extra/debian/init.d/celerybeat`

    * Mac OS X launchd

        `extra/mac/org.celeryq.celeryd.plist`
        `extra/mac/org.celeryq.celerybeat.plist`
        `extra/mac/org.celeryq.celerymon.plist`

    * Supervisord (http://supervisord.org)

        `extra/supervisord/supervisord.conf`

    In addition to `--detach`, the following program arguments has been
    removed: `--uid`, `--gid`, `--workdir`, `--chroot`, `--pidfile`,
    `--umask`. All good daemonization tools should support equivalent
    functionality, so don't worry.

    Also the following configuration keys has been removed:
    `CELERYD_PID_FILE`, `CELERYBEAT_PID_FILE`, `CELERYMON_PID_FILE`.

* Default worker loglevel is now `WARN`, to enable the previous log level
  start the worker with `--loglevel=INFO`.

* Tasks are automatically registered.

    This means you no longer have to register your tasks manually.
    You don't have to change your old code right away, as it doesn't matter if
    a task is registered twice.

    If you don't want your task to be automatically registered you can set
    the `abstract` attribute

    .. code-block:: python

        class MyTask(Task):
            abstract = True

    By using `abstract` only tasks subclassing this task will be automatically
    registered (this works like the Django ORM).

    If you don't want subclasses to be registered either, you can set the
    `autoregister` attribute to `False`.

    Incidentally, this change also fixes the problems with automatic name
    assignment and relative imports. So you also don't have to specify a task name
    anymore if you use relative imports.

* You can no longer use regular functions as tasks.

    This change was added
    because it makes the internals a lot more clean and simple. However, you can
    now turn functions into tasks by using the `@task` decorator:

    .. code-block:: python

        from celery.decorators import task

        @task()
        def add(x, y):
            return x + y

    .. seealso::

        :ref:`guide-tasks` for more information about the task decorators.

* The periodic task system has been rewritten to a centralized solution.

    This means the worker no longer schedules periodic tasks by default,
    but a new daemon has been introduced: `celerybeat`.

    To launch the periodic task scheduler you have to run celerybeat:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ celerybeat

    Make sure this is running on one server only, if you run it twice, all
    periodic tasks will also be executed twice.

    If you only have one worker server you can embed it into the worker like this:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ celeryd --beat # Embed celerybeat in celeryd.

* The supervisor has been removed.

    This means the `-S` and `--supervised` options to `celeryd` is
    no longer supported. Please use something like http://supervisord.org
    instead.

* `TaskSet.join` has been removed, use `TaskSetResult.join` instead.

* The task status `"DONE"` has been renamed to `"SUCCESS"`.

* `AsyncResult.is_done` has been removed, use `AsyncResult.successful`
  instead.

* The worker no longer stores errors if `Task.ignore_result` is set, to
  revert to the previous behaviour set
  :setting:`CELERY_STORE_ERRORS_EVEN_IF_IGNORED` to `True`.

* The statistics functionality has been removed in favor of events,
  so the `-S` and --statistics` switches has been removed.

* The module `celery.task.strategy` has been removed.

* `celery.discovery` has been removed, and it's `autodiscover` function is
  now in `celery.loaders.djangoapp`. Reason: Internal API.

* The :envvar:`CELERY_LOADER` environment variable now needs loader class name
  in addition to module name,

    E.g. where you previously had: `"celery.loaders.default"`, you now need
    `"celery.loaders.default.Loader"`, using the previous syntax will result
    in a `DeprecationWarning`.

* Detecting the loader is now lazy, and so is not done when importing
  `celery.loaders`.

    To make this happen `celery.loaders.settings` has
    been renamed to `load_settings` and is now a function returning the
    settings object. `celery.loaders.current_loader` is now also
    a function, returning the current loader.

    So::

        loader = current_loader

    needs to be changed to::

        loader = current_loader()

.. _v100-deprecations:

Deprecations
------------

* The following configuration variables has been renamed and will be
  deprecated in v2.0:

    * CELERYD_DAEMON_LOG_FORMAT -> CELERYD_LOG_FORMAT
    * CELERYD_DAEMON_LOG_LEVEL -> CELERYD_LOG_LEVEL
    * CELERY_AMQP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT -> CELERY_BROKER_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT
    * CELERY_AMQP_CONNECTION_RETRY -> CELERY_BROKER_CONNECTION_RETRY
    * CELERY_AMQP_CONNECTION_MAX_RETRIES -> CELERY_BROKER_CONNECTION_MAX_RETRIES
    * SEND_CELERY_TASK_ERROR_EMAILS -> CELERY_SEND_TASK_ERROR_EMAILS

* The public API names in celery.conf has also changed to a consistent naming
  scheme.

* We now support consuming from an arbitrary number of queues.

    To do this we had to rename the configuration syntax. If you use any of
    the custom AMQP routing options (queue/exchange/routing_key, etc.), you
    should read the new FAQ entry: :ref:`faq-task-routing`.

    The previous syntax is deprecated and scheduled for removal in v2.0.

* `TaskSet.run` has been renamed to `TaskSet.apply_async`.

    `TaskSet.run` has now been deprecated, and is scheduled for
    removal in v2.0.

.. v100-news:

News
----

* Rate limiting support (per task type, or globally).

* New periodic task system.

* Automatic registration.

* New cool task decorator syntax.

* worker: now sends events if enabled with the `-E` argument.

    Excellent for monitoring tools, one is already in the making
    (http://github.com/celery/celerymon).

    Current events include: :event:`worker-heartbeat`,
    task-[received/succeeded/failed/retried],
    :event:`worker-online`, :event:`worker-offline`.

* You can now delete (revoke) tasks that has already been applied.

* You can now set the hostname the worker identifies as using the `--hostname`
  argument.

* Cache backend now respects the :setting:`CELERY_TASK_RESULT_EXPIRES` setting.

* Message format has been standardized and now uses ISO-8601 format
  for dates instead of datetime.

* worker now responds to the :sig:`SIGHUP` signal by restarting itself.

* Periodic tasks are now scheduled on the clock.

    I.e. `timedelta(hours=1)` means every hour at :00 minutes, not every
    hour from the server starts.  To revert to the previous behaviour you
    can set `PeriodicTask.relative = True`.

* Now supports passing execute options to a TaskSets list of args, e.g.:

    >>> ts = TaskSet(add, [([2, 2], {}, {"countdown": 1}),
    ...                   ([4, 4], {}, {"countdown": 2}),
    ...                   ([8, 8], {}, {"countdown": 3})])
    >>> ts.run()

* Got a 3x performance gain by setting the prefetch count to four times the
  concurrency, (from an average task round-trip of 0.1s to 0.03s!).

    A new setting has been added: :setting:`CELERYD_PREFETCH_MULTIPLIER`, which
    is set to `4` by default.

* Improved support for webhook tasks.

    `celery.task.rest` is now deprecated, replaced with the new and shiny
    :mod:`celery.task.http`. With more reflective names, sensible interface,
    and it's possible to override the methods used to perform HTTP requests.

* The results of task sets are now cached by storing it in the result
  backend.

.. _v100-changes:

Changes
-------

* Now depends on carrot >= 0.8.1

* New dependencies: billiard, python-dateutil, django-picklefield

* No longer depends on python-daemon

* The `uuid` distribution is added as a dependency when running Python 2.4.

* Now remembers the previously detected loader by keeping it in
  the :envvar:`CELERY_LOADER` environment variable.

    This may help on windows where fork emulation is used.

* ETA no longer sends datetime objects, but uses ISO 8601 date format in a
  string for better compatibility with other platforms.

* No longer sends error mails for retried tasks.

* Task can now override the backend used to store results.

* Refactored the ExecuteWrapper, `apply` and :setting:`CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER`
  now also executes the task callbacks and signals.

* Now using a proper scheduler for the tasks with an ETA.

    This means waiting eta tasks are sorted by time, so we don't have
    to poll the whole list all the time.

* Now also imports modules listed in :setting:`CELERY_IMPORTS` when running
  with django (as documented).

* Log level for stdout/stderr changed from INFO to ERROR

* ImportErrors are now properly propagated when autodiscovering tasks.

* You can now use `celery.messaging.establish_connection` to establish a
  connection to the broker.

* When running as a separate service the periodic task scheduler does some
  smart moves to not poll too regularly.

    If you need faster poll times you can lower the value
    of :setting:`CELERYBEAT_MAX_LOOP_INTERVAL`.

* You can now change periodic task intervals at runtime, by making
  `run_every` a property, or subclassing `PeriodicTask.is_due`.

* The worker now supports control commands enabled through the use of a
  broadcast queue, you can remotely revoke tasks or set the rate limit for
  a task type. See :mod:`celery.task.control`.

* The services now sets informative process names (as shown in `ps`
  listings) if the :mod:`setproctitle` module is installed.

* :exc:`~@NotRegistered` now inherits from :exc:`KeyError`,
  and `TaskRegistry.__getitem__`+`pop` raises `NotRegistered` instead

* You can set the loader via the :envvar:`CELERY_LOADER` environment variable.

* You can now set :setting:`CELERY_IGNORE_RESULT` to ignore task results by
  default (if enabled, tasks doesn't save results or errors to the backend used).

* The worker now correctly handles malformed messages by throwing away and
  acknowledging the message, instead of crashing.

.. _v100-bugs:

Bugs
----

* Fixed a race condition that could happen while storing task results in the
  database.

.. _v100-documentation:

-------------

* Reference now split into two sections; API reference and internal module
  reference.

.. _version-0.8.4:

0.8.4
=====
:release-date: 2010-02-05 01:52 P.M CEST
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Now emits a warning if the --detach argument is used.
  --detach should not be used anymore, as it has several not easily fixed
  bugs related to it. Instead, use something like start-stop-daemon,
  Supervisord or launchd (os x).


* Make sure logger class is process aware, even if running Python >= 2.6.


* Error emails are not sent anymore when the task is retried.

.. _version-0.8.3:

0.8.3
=====
:release-date: 2009-12-22 09:43 A.M CEST
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Fixed a possible race condition that could happen when storing/querying
  task results using the database backend.

* Now has console script entry points in the setup.py file, so tools like
  Buildout will correctly install the programs celeryd and celeryinit.

.. _version-0.8.2:

0.8.2
=====
:release-date: 2009-11-20 03:40 P.M CEST
:release-by: Ask Solem

* QOS Prefetch count was not applied properly, as it was set for every message
  received (which apparently behaves like, "receive one more"), instead of only
  set when our wanted value changed.

.. _version-0.8.1:

0.8.1
=================================
:release-date: 2009-11-16 05:21 P.M CEST
:release-by: Ask Solem

.. _v081-very-important:

Very important note
-------------------

This release (with carrot 0.8.0) enables AMQP QoS (quality of service), which
means the workers will only receive as many messages as it can handle at a
time. As with any release, you should test this version upgrade on your
development servers before rolling it out to production!

.. _v081-important:

Important changes
-----------------

* If you're using Python < 2.6 and you use the multiprocessing backport, then
  multiprocessing version 2.6.2.1 is required.

* All AMQP_* settings has been renamed to BROKER_*, and in addition
  AMQP_SERVER has been renamed to BROKER_HOST, so before where you had::

        AMQP_SERVER = "localhost"
        AMQP_PORT = 5678
        AMQP_USER = "myuser"
        AMQP_PASSWORD = "mypassword"
        AMQP_VHOST = "celery"

  You need to change that to::

        BROKER_HOST = "localhost"
        BROKER_PORT = 5678
        BROKER_USER = "myuser"
        BROKER_PASSWORD = "mypassword"
        BROKER_VHOST = "celery"

* Custom carrot backends now need to include the backend class name, so before
  where you had::

        CARROT_BACKEND = "mycustom.backend.module"

  you need to change it to::

        CARROT_BACKEND = "mycustom.backend.module.Backend"

  where `Backend` is the class name. This is probably `"Backend"`, as
  that was the previously implied name.

* New version requirement for carrot: 0.8.0

.. _v081-changes:

Changes
-------

* Incorporated the multiprocessing backport patch that fixes the
  `processName` error.

* Ignore the result of PeriodicTask's by default.

* Added a Redis result store backend

* Allow /etc/default/celeryd to define additional options for the celeryd init
  script.

* MongoDB periodic tasks issue when using different time than UTC fixed.

* Windows specific: Negate test for available os.fork (thanks miracle2k)

* Now tried to handle broken PID files.

* Added a Django test runner to contrib that sets
  `CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER = True` for testing with the database backend.

* Added a :setting:`CELERY_CACHE_BACKEND` setting for using something other
  than the django-global cache backend.

* Use custom implementation of functools.partial (curry) for Python 2.4 support
  (Probably still problems with running on 2.4, but it will eventually be
  supported)

* Prepare exception to pickle when saving :state:`RETRY` status for all backends.

* SQLite no concurrency limit should only be effective if the database backend
  is used.


.. _version-0.8.0:

0.8.0
=====
:release-date: 2009-09-22 03:06 P.M CEST
:release-by: Ask Solem

.. _v080-incompatible:

Backward incompatible changes
-----------------------------

* Add traceback to result value on failure.

    .. note::

        If you use the database backend you have to re-create the
        database table `celery_taskmeta`.

        Contact the :ref:`mailing-list` or :ref:`irc-channel` channel
        for help doing this.

* Database tables are now only created if the database backend is used,
  so if you change back to the database backend at some point,
  be sure to initialize tables (django: `syncdb`, python: `celeryinit`).

  .. note::

     This is only applies if using Django version 1.1 or higher.

* Now depends on `carrot` version 0.6.0.

* Now depends on python-daemon 1.4.8

.. _v080-important:

Important changes
-----------------

* Celery can now be used in pure Python (outside of a Django project).

    This means celery is no longer Django specific.

    For more information see the FAQ entry
    :ref:`faq-is-celery-for-django-only`.

* Celery now supports task retries.

    See :ref:`task-retry` for more information.

* We now have an AMQP result store backend.

    It uses messages to publish task return value and status. And it's
    incredibly fast!

    See issue #6 for more info!

* AMQP QoS (prefetch count) implemented:

    This to not receive more messages than we can handle.

* Now redirects stdout/stderr to the workers log file when detached

* Now uses `inspect.getargspec` to only pass default arguments
    the task supports.

* Add Task.on_success, .on_retry, .on_failure handlers
    See :meth:`celery.task.base.Task.on_success`,
        :meth:`celery.task.base.Task.on_retry`,
        :meth:`celery.task.base.Task.on_failure`,

* `celery.utils.gen_unique_id`: Workaround for
    http://bugs.python.org/issue4607

* You can now customize what happens at worker start, at process init, etc.,
    by creating your own loaders. (see :mod:`celery.loaders.default`,
    :mod:`celery.loaders.djangoapp`, :mod:`celery.loaders`.)

* Support for multiple AMQP exchanges and queues.

    This feature misses documentation and tests, so anyone interested
    is encouraged to improve this situation.

* The worker now survives a restart of the AMQP server!

  Automatically re-establish AMQP broker connection if it's lost.

  New settings:

    * AMQP_CONNECTION_RETRY
        Set to `True` to enable connection retries.

    * AMQP_CONNECTION_MAX_RETRIES.
        Maximum number of restarts before we give up. Default: `100`.

.. _v080-news:

News
----

*  Fix an incompatibility between python-daemon and multiprocessing,
    which resulted in the `[Errno 10] No child processes` problem when
    detaching.

* Fixed a possible DjangoUnicodeDecodeError being raised when saving pickled
    data to Django`s memcached cache backend.

* Better Windows compatibility.

* New version of the pickled field (taken from
    http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/513/)

* New signals introduced: `task_sent`, `task_prerun` and
    `task_postrun`, see :mod:`celery.signals` for more information.

* `TaskSetResult.join` caused `TypeError` when `timeout=None`.
    Thanks Jerzy Kozera.  Closes #31

* `views.apply` should return `HttpResponse` instance.
    Thanks to Jerzy Kozera. Closes #32

* `PeriodicTask`: Save conversion of `run_every` from `int`
    to `timedelta` to the class attribute instead of on the instance.

* Exceptions has been moved to `celery.exceptions`, but are still
    available in the previous module.

* Try to rollback transaction and retry saving result if an error happens
    while setting task status with the database backend.

* jail() refactored into :class:`celery.execute.ExecuteWrapper`.

* `views.apply` now correctly sets mime-type to "application/json"

* `views.task_status` now returns exception if state is :state:`RETRY`

* `views.task_status` now returns traceback if state is :state:`FAILURE`
    or :state:`RETRY`

* Documented default task arguments.

* Add a sensible __repr__ to ExceptionInfo for easier debugging

* Fix documentation typo `.. import map` -> `.. import dmap`.
    Thanks to mikedizon

.. _version-0.6.0:

0.6.0
=====
:release-date: 2009-08-07 06:54 A.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

.. _v060-important:

Important changes
-----------------

* Fixed a bug where tasks raising unpickleable exceptions crashed pool
    workers. So if you've had pool workers mysteriously disappearing, or
    problems with the worker stopping working, this has been fixed in this
    version.

* Fixed a race condition with periodic tasks.

* The task pool is now supervised, so if a pool worker crashes,
    goes away or stops responding, it is automatically replaced with
    a new one.

* Task.name is now automatically generated out of class module+name, e.g.
    `"djangotwitter.tasks.UpdateStatusesTask"`. Very convenient. No idea why
    we didn't do this before. Some documentation is updated to not manually
    specify a task name.

.. _v060-news:

News
----

* Tested with Django 1.1

* New Tutorial: Creating a click counter using carrot and celery

* Database entries for periodic tasks are now created at the workers
    startup instead of for each check (which has been a forgotten TODO/XXX
    in the code for a long time)

* New settings variable: :setting:`CELERY_TASK_RESULT_EXPIRES`
    Time (in seconds, or a `datetime.timedelta` object) for when after
    stored task results are deleted. For the moment this only works for the
    database backend.

* The worker now emits a debug log message for which periodic tasks
    has been launched.

* The periodic task table is now locked for reading while getting
    periodic task status. (MySQL only so far, seeking patches for other
    engines)

* A lot more debugging information is now available by turning on the
    `DEBUG` log level (`--loglevel=DEBUG`).

* Functions/methods with a timeout argument now works correctly.

* New: `celery.strategy.even_time_distribution`:
    With an iterator yielding task args, kwargs tuples, evenly distribute
    the processing of its tasks throughout the time window available.

* Log message `Unknown task ignored...` now has log level `ERROR`

* Log message when task is received is now emitted for all tasks, even if
    the task has an ETA (estimated time of arrival). Also the log message now
    includes the ETA for the task (if any).

* Acknowledgement now happens in the pool callback. Can't do ack in the job
    target, as it's not pickleable (can't share AMQP connection, etc.)).

* Added note about .delay hanging in README

* Tests now passing in Django 1.1

* Fixed discovery to make sure app is in INSTALLED_APPS

* Previously overridden pool behavior (process reap, wait until pool worker
    available, etc.) is now handled by `multiprocessing.Pool` itself.

* Convert statistics data to Unicode for use as kwargs. Thanks Lucy!

.. _version-0.4.1:

0.4.1
=====
:release-date: 2009-07-02 01:42 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

  `routing_key`, `priority`, `immediate`)

.. _version-0.4.0:

0.4.0
=====
:release-date: 2009-07-01 07:29 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Adds eager execution. `celery.execute.apply`|`Task.apply` executes the
  function blocking until the task is done, for API compatibility it
  returns an `celery.result.EagerResult` instance. You can configure
  celery to always run tasks locally by setting the
  :setting:`CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER` setting to `True`.

* Now depends on `anyjson`.

* 99% coverage using python `coverage` 3.0.

.. _version-0.3.20:

0.3.20
======
:release-date: 2009-06-25 08:42 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

* New arguments to `apply_async` (the advanced version of
  `delay_task`), `countdown` and `eta`;

    >>> # Run 10 seconds into the future.
    >>> res = apply_async(MyTask, countdown=10);

    >>> # Run 1 day from now
    >>> res = apply_async(MyTask,
    ...                   eta=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1))

* Now unlinks stale PID files

* Lots of more tests.

* Now compatible with carrot >= 0.5.0.

* **IMPORTANT** The `subtask_ids` attribute on the `TaskSetResult`
  instance has been removed. To get this information instead use:

        >>> subtask_ids = [subtask.id for subtask in ts_res.subtasks]

* `Taskset.run()` now respects extra message options from the task class.

* Task: Add attribute `ignore_result`: Don't store the status and
  return value. This means you can't use the
  `celery.result.AsyncResult` to check if the task is
  done, or get its return value. Only use if you need the performance
  and is able live without these features. Any exceptions raised will
  store the return value/status as usual.

* Task: Add attribute `disable_error_emails` to disable sending error
  emails for that task.

* Should now work on Windows (although running in the background won't
  work, so using the `--detach` argument results in an exception
  being raised.)

* Added support for statistics for profiling and monitoring.
  To start sending statistics start the worker with the
  `--statistics option. Then after a while you can dump the results
  by running `python manage.py celerystats`. See
  `celery.monitoring` for more information.

* The celery daemon can now be supervised (i.e. it is automatically
  restarted if it crashes). To use this start the worker with the
  --supervised` option (or alternatively `-S`).

* views.apply: View calling a task. Example

    ::

        http://e.com/celery/apply/task_name/arg1/arg2//?kwarg1=a&kwarg2=b


    .. warning::

        Use with caution! Do not expose this URL to the public
        without first ensuring that your code is safe!

* Refactored `celery.task`. It's now split into three modules:

    * celery.task

        Contains `apply_async`, `delay_task`, `discard_all`, and task
        shortcuts, plus imports objects from `celery.task.base` and
        `celery.task.builtins`

    * celery.task.base

        Contains task base classes: `Task`, `PeriodicTask`,
        `TaskSet`, `AsynchronousMapTask`, `ExecuteRemoteTask`.

    * celery.task.builtins

        Built-in tasks: `PingTask`, `DeleteExpiredTaskMetaTask`.

.. _version-0.3.7:

0.3.7
=====
:release-date: 2008-06-16 11:41 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

* **IMPORTANT** Now uses AMQP`s `basic.consume` instead of
  `basic.get`. This means we're no longer polling the broker for
  new messages.

* **IMPORTANT** Default concurrency limit is now set to the number of CPUs
  available on the system.

* **IMPORTANT** `tasks.register`: Renamed `task_name` argument to
  `name`, so

        >>> tasks.register(func, task_name="mytask")

  has to be replaced with:

        >>> tasks.register(func, name="mytask")

* The daemon now correctly runs if the pidlock is stale.

* Now compatible with carrot 0.4.5

* Default AMQP connection timeout is now 4 seconds.
* `AsyncResult.read()` was always returning `True`.

*  Only use README as long_description if the file exists so easy_install
   doesn't break.

* `celery.view`: JSON responses now properly set its mime-type.

* `apply_async` now has a `connection` keyword argument so you
  can re-use the same AMQP connection if you want to execute
  more than one task.

* Handle failures in task_status view such that it won't throw 500s.

* Fixed typo `AMQP_SERVER` in documentation to `AMQP_HOST`.

* Worker exception emails sent to administrators now works properly.

* No longer depends on `django`, so installing `celery` won't affect
  the preferred Django version installed.

* Now works with PostgreSQL (psycopg2) again by registering the
  `PickledObject` field.

* Worker: Added `--detach` option as an alias to `--daemon`, and
  it's the term used in the documentation from now on.

* Make sure the pool and periodic task worker thread is terminated
  properly at exit. (So `Ctrl-C` works again).

* Now depends on `python-daemon`.

* Removed dependency to `simplejson`

* Cache Backend: Re-establishes connection for every task process
  if the Django cache backend is memcached/libmemcached.

* Tyrant Backend: Now re-establishes the connection for every task
  executed.

* Default `QUEUE_WAKEUP_AFTER` has been lowered to `0.1` (was `0.3`)

.. _version-0.3.0:

0.3.0
=====
:release-date: 2009-06-08 12:41 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

.. warning::

    This is a development version, for the stable release, please
    see versions 0.2.x.

**VERY IMPORTANT:** Pickle is now the encoder used for serializing task
arguments, so be sure to flush your task queue before you upgrade.

* **IMPORTANT** TaskSet.run() now returns a celery.result.TaskSetResult
  instance, which lets you inspect the status and return values of a
  taskset as it was a single entity.

* **IMPORTANT** Celery now depends on carrot >= 0.4.1.

* The celery daemon now sends task errors to the registered admin emails.
  To turn off this feature, set `SEND_CELERY_TASK_ERROR_EMAILS` to
  `False` in your `settings.py`. Thanks to Grégoire Cachet.

* You can now run the celery daemon by using `manage.py`:

  .. code-block:: console

        $ python manage.py celeryd

  Thanks to Grégoire Cachet.

* Added support for message priorities, topic exchanges, custom routing
  keys for tasks. This means we have introduced
  `celery.task.apply_async`, a new way of executing tasks.

  You can use `celery.task.delay` and `celery.Task.delay` like usual, but
  if you want greater control over the message sent, you want
  `celery.task.apply_async` and `celery.Task.apply_async`.

  This also means the AMQP configuration has changed. Some settings has
  been renamed, while others are new::

        CELERY_AMQP_EXCHANGE
        CELERY_AMQP_PUBLISHER_ROUTING_KEY
        CELERY_AMQP_CONSUMER_ROUTING_KEY
        CELERY_AMQP_CONSUMER_QUEUE
        CELERY_AMQP_EXCHANGE_TYPE

  See the entry :ref:`faq-task-routing` in the
  :ref:`FAQ <faq>` for more information.

* Task errors are now logged using log level `ERROR` instead of `INFO`,
  and stacktraces are dumped. Thanks to Grégoire Cachet.

* Make every new worker process re-establish it's Django DB connection,
  this solving the "MySQL connection died?" exceptions.
  Thanks to Vitaly Babiy and Jirka Vejrazka.

* **IMPORTANT** Now using pickle to encode task arguments. This means you
  now can pass complex python objects to tasks as arguments.

* Removed dependency to `yadayada`.

* Added a FAQ, see `docs/faq.rst`.

* Now converts any Unicode keys in task `kwargs` to regular strings.
  Thanks Vitaly Babiy.

* Renamed the `TaskDaemon` to `WorkController`.

* `celery.datastructures.TaskProcessQueue` is now renamed to
  `celery.pool.TaskPool`.

* The pool algorithm has been refactored for greater performance and
  stability.

.. _version-0.1.15:

0.1.15
======
:release-date: 2009-05-19 04:13 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

* The celery daemon was leaking AMQP connections, this should be fixed,
  if you have any problems with too many files open (like `emfile`
  errors in `rabbit.log`, please contact us!

.. _version-0.1.14:

0.1.14
======
:release-date: 2009-05-19 01:08 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Fixed a syntax error in the `TaskSet` class.  (No such variable
  `TimeOutError`).

.. _version-0.1.13:

0.1.13
======
:release-date: 2009-05-19 12:36 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Forgot to add `yadayada` to install requirements.

* Now deletes all expired task results, not just those marked as done.

* Able to load the Tokyo Tyrant backend class without django
  configuration, can specify tyrant settings directly in the class
  constructor.

* Improved API documentation

* Now using the Sphinx documentation system, you can build
  the html documentation by doing:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ cd docs
        $ make html

  and the result will be in `docs/.build/html`.

.. _version-0.1.12:

0.1.12
======
:release-date: 2009-05-18 04:38 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

* `delay_task()` etc. now returns `celery.task.AsyncResult` object,
  which lets you check the result and any failure that might have
  happened.  It kind of works like the `multiprocessing.AsyncResult`
  class returned by `multiprocessing.Pool.map_async`.

* Added dmap() and dmap_async(). This works like the
  `multiprocessing.Pool` versions except they are tasks
  distributed to the celery server. Example:

        >>> from celery.task import dmap
        >>> import operator
        >>> dmap(operator.add, [[2, 2], [4, 4], [8, 8]])
        >>> [4, 8, 16]

        >>> from celery.task import dmap_async
        >>> import operator
        >>> result = dmap_async(operator.add, [[2, 2], [4, 4], [8, 8]])
        >>> result.ready()
        False
        >>> time.sleep(1)
        >>> result.ready()
        True
        >>> result.result
        [4, 8, 16]

* Refactored the task metadata cache and database backends, and added
  a new backend for Tokyo Tyrant. You can set the backend in your django
  settings file. E.g.::

        CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = "database"; # Uses the database
        CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = "cache"; # Uses the django cache framework
        CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = "tyrant"; # Uses Tokyo Tyrant
        TT_HOST = "localhost"; # Hostname for the Tokyo Tyrant server.
        TT_PORT = 6657; # Port of the Tokyo Tyrant server.

.. _version-0.1.11:

0.1.11
======
:release-date: 2009-05-12 02:08 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

* The logging system was leaking file descriptors, resulting in
  servers stopping with the EMFILES (too many open files) error. (fixed)

.. _version-0.1.10:

0.1.10
======
:release-date: 2009-05-11 12:46 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Requires carrot 0.3.8.

* The daemon now tries to reconnect if the connection is lost.

.. _version-0.1.8:

0.1.8
=====
:release-date: 2009-05-07 12:27 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Better test coverage
* More documentation
* The worker doesn't emit `Queue is empty` message if
  `settings.CELERYD_EMPTY_MSG_EMIT_EVERY` is 0.

.. _version-0.1.7:

0.1.7
=====
:release-date: 2009-04-30 01:50 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Added some unit tests

* Can now use the database for task metadata (like if the task has
  been executed or not). Set `settings.CELERY_TASK_META`

* Can now run `python setup.py test` to run the unit tests from
  within the `tests` project.

* Can set the AMQP exchange/routing key/queue using
  `settings.CELERY_AMQP_EXCHANGE`, `settings.CELERY_AMQP_ROUTING_KEY`,
  and `settings.CELERY_AMQP_CONSUMER_QUEUE`.

.. _version-0.1.6:

0.1.6
=====
:release-date: 2009-04-28 02:13 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Introducing `TaskSet`. A set of subtasks is executed and you can
  find out how many, or if all them, are done (excellent for progress
  bars and such)

* Now catches all exceptions when running `Task.__call__`, so the
  daemon doesn't die. This doesn't happen for pure functions yet, only
  `Task` classes.

* `autodiscover()` now works with zipped eggs.

* Worker: Now adds current working directory to `sys.path` for
  convenience.

* The `run_every` attribute of `PeriodicTask` classes can now be a
  `datetime.timedelta()` object.

* Worker: You can now set the `DJANGO_PROJECT_DIR` variable
  for the worker and it will add that to `sys.path` for easy launching.

* Can now check if a task has been executed or not via HTTP.

* You can do this by including the celery `urls.py` into your project,

        >>> url(r'^celery/$', include("celery.urls"))

  then visiting the following url,::

        http://mysite/celery/$task_id/done/

  this will return a JSON dictionary like e.g:

        >>> {"task": {"id": $task_id, "executed": true}}

* `delay_task` now returns string id, not `uuid.UUID` instance.

* Now has `PeriodicTasks`, to have `cron` like functionality.

* Project changed name from `crunchy` to `celery`. The details of
  the name change request is in `docs/name_change_request.txt`.
