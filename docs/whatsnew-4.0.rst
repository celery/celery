Important Notes
===============

Dropped support for Python 2.6
------------------------------

Celery now requires Python 2.7 or later,
and also drops support for Python 3.3 so supported versions are:

- CPython 2.7
- CPython 3.4
- CPython 3.5
- PyPy 4.0 (``pypy2``)
- PyPy 2.4 (``pypy3``)

Last major version to support Python 2
--------------------------------------

Starting from Celery 5.0 only Python 3.6+ will be supported.

To make sure you're not affected by this change you should pin
the Celery version in your requirements file, either to a specific
version: ``celery==4.0.0``, or a range: ``celery>=4.0,<5.0``.

Dropping support for Python 2 will enable us to remove massive
amounts of compatibility code, and going with Python 3.6 allows
us to take advantage of typing, async/await, asyncio, and similar
concepts there's no alternative for in older versions.

Celery 4.x will continue to work on Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5; just as Celery 3.x
still works on Python 2.6.

Removed features
----------------

- Microsoft Windows is no longer supported.

- Jython is no longer supported.

Features removed for simplicity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Webhook task machinery (``celery.task.http``) has been removed.

    Nowadays it's easy to use the :pypi:`requests` module to write
    webhook tasks manually. We would love to use requests but we
    are simply unable to as there's a very vocal 'anti-dependency'
    mob in the Python community

    If you need backwards compatibility
    you can simply copy + paste the 3.1 version of the module and make sure
    it's imported by the worker:
    https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/3.1/celery/task/http.py

- Task no longer sends error emails.

    This also removes support for ``app.mail_admins``, and any functionality
    related to sending emails.

- ``celery.contrib.batches`` has been removed.

    This was an experimental feature, so not covered by our deprecation
    timeline guarantee.

Features removed for lack of funding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We announced with the 3.1 release that some transports were
moved to experimental status, and that there'd be no official
support for the transports, citing a lack of resources.

As this subtle hint for the need of funding failed
we've removed them completely, breaking backwards compatibility.

- Using MongoDB as a broker is no longer supported.

- Using the Django ORM as a broker is no longer supported.

- Using SQLAlchemy as a broker is no longer supported.

- Using CouchDB as a broker is no longer supported.

- Using IronMQ as a broker is no longer supported.

- Using Beanstalk as a broker is no longer supported.

In addition some features have been removed completely so that
attempting to use them will raise an exception:

- The ``--autoreload`` feature has been removed.

  This was an experimental feature, and not covered by our deprecation
  timeline guarantee. The flag is removed completely so the worker
  will crash at startup when present. Luckily this
  flag isn't used in production systems.

- The ``--autoscale`` feature has been removed.

    This flag is only used by companies to save money, but had
    bugs either nobody cared to work on, or sponsor a few hours of work to get it fixed.

    The flag has been removed completely, so you must remove this command-line
    argument or your workers will crash.

- The experimental ``threads`` pool is no longer supported and has been removed.

- The force_execv feature is no longer supported.

    The ``celery worker`` command now ignores the ``--no-execv``,
    ``--force-execv``, and the ``CELERYD_FORCE_EXECV`` setting.

    This flag will be removed completely in 5.0 and the worker
    will raise an error.

- The old legacy "amqp" result backend has been deprecated, and will
  be removed in Celery 5.0.

    Please use the ``rpc`` result backend for RPC-style calls, and a
    persistent result backend for multi-consumer results.


**Now to the good news**...

New Task Message Protocol
-------------------------
.. :sha:`e71652d384b1b5df2a4e6145df9f0efb456bc71c`

This version introduces a brand new task message protocol,
the first major change to the protocol since the beginning of the project.

The new protocol is enabled by default in this version and since the new
version isn't backwards compatible you have to be careful when upgrading.

The 3.1.24 version was released to add compatibility with the new protocol
so the easiest way to upgrade is to upgrade to that version first, then
upgrade to 4.0 in a second deployment.

If you wish to keep using the old protocol you may also configure
the protocol version number used:

.. code-block:: python

    app = Celery()
    app.conf.task_protocol = 1

Read more about the features available in the new protocol in the news
section found later in this document.

Lowercase setting names
-----------------------

In the pursuit of beauty all settings are now renamed to be in all
lowercase and some setting names have been renamed for consistency.

This change is fully backwards compatible so you can still use the uppercase
setting names, but we would like you to upgrade as soon as possible and
you can this automatically using the :program:`celery upgrade settings`
command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ celery upgrade settings proj/settings.py

This command will modify your module in-place to use the new lower-case
names (if you want uppercase with a "``CELERY``" prefix see block below),
and save a backup in :file:`proj/settings.py.orig`.

.. admonition:: For Django users and others who want to keep uppercase names

    If you're loading Celery configuration from the Django settings module
    then you'll want to keep using the uppercase names.

    You also want to use a ``CELERY_`` prefix so that no Celery settings
    collide with Django settings used by other apps.

    To do this, you'll first need to convert your settings file
    to use the new consistent naming scheme, and add the prefix to all
    Celery related settings:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ celery upgrade settings --django proj/settings.py

    After upgrading the settings file, you need to set the prefix explicitly
    in your ``proj/celery.py`` module:

    .. code-block:: python

        app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY')

    You can find the most up to date Django Celery integration example
    here: :ref:`django-first-steps`.

    Note that this will also add a prefix to settings that didn't previously
    have one, like ``BROKER_URL``.

    Luckily you don't have to manually change the files, as
    the :program:`celery upgrade settings --django` program should do the
    right thing.

The loader will try to detect if your configuration is using the new format,
and act accordingly, but this also means you're not allowed to mix and
match new and old setting names, that's unless you provide a value for both
alternatives.

The major difference between previous versions, apart from the lower case
names, are the renaming of some prefixes, like ``celerybeat_`` to ``beat_``,
``celeryd_`` to ``worker_``.

The ``celery_`` prefix has also been removed, and task related settings
from this name-space is now prefixed by ``task_``, worker related settings
with ``worker_``.

Apart from this most of the settings will be the same in lowercase, apart from
a few special ones:

=====================================  ==========================================================
**Setting name**                       **Replace with**
=====================================  ==========================================================
``CELERY_MAX_CACHED_RESULTS``          :setting:`result_cache_max`
``CELERY_MESSAGE_COMPRESSION``         :setting:`result_compression`/:setting:`task_compression`.
``CELERY_TASK_RESULT_EXPIRES``         :setting:`result_expires`
``CELERY_RESULT_DBURI``                :setting:`sqlalchemy_dburi`
``CELERY_RESULT_ENGINE_OPTIONS``       :setting:`sqlalchemy_engine_options`
``-*-_DB_SHORT_LIVED_SESSIONS``        :setting:`sqlalchemy_short_lived_sessions`
``CELERY_RESULT_DB_TABLE_NAMES``       :setting:`sqlalchemy_db_names`
``CELERY_ACKS_LATE``                   :setting:`task_acks_late`
``CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER``                :setting:`task_always_eager`

``CELERY_DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT``          :setting:`task_default_rate_limit`
``CELERY_DEFAULT_ROUTING_KEY``         :setting:`task_default_routing_key`

``CELERY_DISABLE_RATE_LIMITS``         :setting:`worker_disable_rate_limits`
``CELERY_ENABLE_REMOTE_CONTROL``       :setting:`worker_enable_remote_control`
``CELERYD_SEND_EVENTS``                :setting:`worker_send_task_events`
=====================================  ==========================================================

You can see a full table of the changes in :ref:`conf-old-settings-map`.

JSON is now the default serializer
----------------------------------

The time has finally come to end the reign of :mod:`pickle` as the default
serialization mechanism, and json is the default serializer starting from this
version.

This change was :ref:`announced with the release of Celery 3.1
<last-version-to-enable-pickle>`.

If you're still depending on :mod:`pickle` being the default serializer,
then you have to configure your app before upgrading to 4.0:

.. code-block:: python

    task_serializer = 'pickle'
    result_serializer = 'pickle'
    accept_content = {'pickle'}

The Task base class no longer automatically register tasks
----------------------------------------------------------

The :class:`~@Task` class is no longer using a special meta-class
that automatically registers the task in the task registry.

Instead this is now handled by the :class:`@task` decorators.

If you're still using class based tasks, then you need to register
these manually:

.. code-block:: python

    class CustomTask(Task):
        def run(self):
            print('running')
    app.tasks.register(CustomTask())

The best practice is to use custom task classes only for overriding
general behavior, and then using the task decorator to realize the task:

.. code-block:: python

    @app.task(bind=True, base=CustomTask)
    def custom(self):
        print('running')

This change also means the ``abstract`` attribute of the task
no longer has any effect.

Task argument checking
----------------------

The arguments of the task are now verified when calling the task,
even asynchronously:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> @app.task
    ... def add(x, y):
    ...     return x + y

    >>> add.delay(8, 8)
    <AsyncResult: f59d71ca-1549-43e0-be41-4e8821a83c0c>

    >>> add.delay(8)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
      File "celery/app/task.py", line 376, in delay
        return self.apply_async(args, kwargs)
      File "celery/app/task.py", line 485, in apply_async
        check_arguments(*(args or ()), **(kwargs or {}))
    TypeError: add() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)

Redis Events not backward compatible
------------------------------------

The Redis ``fanout_patterns`` and ``fanout_prefix`` transport
options are now enabled by default.

Workers/monitors without these flags enabled won't be able to
see workers with this flag disabled. They can still execute tasks,
but they cannot receive each others monitoring messages.

You can upgrade in a backward compatible manner by first configuring
your 3.1 workers and monitors to enable the settings, before the final
upgrade to 4.0:

.. code-block:: python

    BROKER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS = {
        'fanout_patterns': True,
        'fanout_prefix': True,
    }

Django: Auto-discover now supports Django app configurations
------------------------------------------------------------

The :meth:`@autodiscover` function can now be called without arguments,
and the Django handler will automatically find your installed apps:

.. code-block:: python

    app.autodiscover()

The Django integration :ref:`example in the documentation
<django-first-steps>` has been updated to use the argument-less call.

This also ensures comaptibility with the new, ehm, ``appconfig`` stuff
introduced in recent Django versions.

Worker direct queues no longer use auto-delete
----------------------------------------------

Workers/clients running 4.0 will no longer be able to send
worker direct messages to workers running older versions, and vice versa.

If you're relying on worker direct messages you should upgrade
your 3.x workers and clients to use the new routing settings first,
by replacing :func:`celery.utils.worker_direct` with this implementation:

.. code-block:: python

    from kombu import Exchange, Queue

    worker_direct_exchange = Exchange('C.dq2')

    def worker_direct(hostname):
        return Queue(
            '{hostname}.dq2'.format(hostname),
            exchange=worker_direct_exchange,
            routing_key=hostname,
        )

This feature closed Issue #2492.


Old command-line programs removed
---------------------------------

Installing Celery will no longer install the ``celeryd``,
``celerybeat`` and ``celeryd-multi`` programs.

This was announced with the release of Celery 3.1, but you may still
have scripts pointing to the old names so make sure you update these
to use the new umbrella command:

+-------------------+--------------+-------------------------------------+
| Program           | New Status   | Replacement                         |
+===================+==============+=====================================+
| ``celeryd``       | **REMOVED**  | :program:`celery worker`            |
+-------------------+--------------+-------------------------------------+
| ``celerybeat``    | **REMOVED**  | :program:`celery beat`              |
+-------------------+--------------+-------------------------------------+
| ``celeryd-multi`` | **REMOVED**  | :program:`celery multi`             |
+-------------------+--------------+-------------------------------------+

New protocol highlights
-----------------------

The new protocol fixes many problems with the old one, and enables
some long-requested features:

- Most of the data are now sent as message headers, instead of being
  serialized with the message body.

    In version 1 of the protocol the worker always had to deserialize
    the message to be able to read task meta-data like the task id,
    name, etc. This also meant that the worker was forced to double-decode
    the data, first deserializing the message on receipt, serializing
    the message again to send to child process, then finally the child process
    deserializes the message again.

    Keeping the meta-data fields in the message headers means the worker
    doesn't actually have to decode the payload before delivering
    the task to the child process, and also that it's now possible
    for the worker to reroute a task written in a language different
    from Python to a different worker.

- A new ``lang`` message header can be used to specify the programming
  language the task is written in.

- Worker stores results for internal errors like ``ContentDisallowed``,
  and other deserialization errors.

- Worker stores results and sends monitoring events for unregistered
  task errors.

- Worker calls callbacks/errbacks even when the result is sent by the
  parent process (e.g., :exc:`WorkerLostError` when a child process
  terminates, deserialization errors, unregistered tasks).

- A new ``origin`` header contains information about the process sending
  the task (worker node-name, or PID and host-name information).

- A new ``shadow`` header allows you to modify the task name used in logs.

    This is useful for dispatch like patterns, like a task that calls
    any function using pickle (don't do this at home):

    .. code-block:: python

        from celery import Task
        from celery.utils.imports import qualname

        class call_as_task(Task):

            def shadow_name(self, args, kwargs, options):
                return 'call_as_task:{0}'.format(qualname(args[0]))

            def run(self, fun, *args, **kwargs):
                return fun(*args, **kwargs)
        call_as_task = app.tasks.register(call_as_task())

- New ``argsrepr`` and ``kwargsrepr`` fields contain textual representations
  of the task arguments (possibly truncated) for use in logs, monitors, etc.

    This means the worker doesn't have to deserialize the message payload
    to display the task arguments for informational purposes.

- Chains now use a dedicated ``chain`` field enabling support for chains
  of thousands and more tasks.

- New ``parent_id`` and ``root_id`` headers adds information about
  a tasks relationship with other tasks.

    - ``parent_id`` is the task id of the task that called this task
    - ``root_id`` is the first task in the work-flow.

    These fields can be used to improve monitors like flower to group
    related messages together (like chains, groups, chords, complete
    work-flows, etc).

- ``app.TaskProducer`` replaced by :meth:`@amqp.create_task_message` and
  :meth:`@amqp.send_task_message`.

    Dividing the responsibilities into creating and sending means that
    people who want to send messages using a Python AMQP client directly,
    doesn't have to implement the protocol.

    The :meth:`@amqp.create_task_message` method calls either
    :meth:`@amqp.as_task_v2`, or :meth:`@amqp.as_task_v1` depending
    on the configured task protocol, and returns a special
    :class:`~celery.app.amqp.task_message` tuple containing the
    headers, properties and body of the task message.

.. seealso::

    The new task protocol is documented in full here:
    :ref:`message-protocol-task-v2`.

Prefork: Tasks now log from the child process
---------------------------------------------

Logging of task success/failure now happens from the child process
executing the task.  As a result logging utilities,
like Sentry can get full information about tasks, including
variables in the traceback stack.

Prefork: One log-file per child process
---------------------------------------

Init-scrips and :program:`celery multi` now uses the `%I` log file format
option (e.g., :file:`/var/log/celery/%n%I.log`).

This change was necessary to ensure each child
process has a separate log file after moving task logging
to the child process, as multiple processes writing to the same
log file can cause corruption.

You're encouraged to upgrade your init-scripts and
:program:`celery multi` arguments to use this new option.

Configure broker URL for read/write separately
----------------------------------------------

New :setting:`broker_read_url` and :setting:`broker_write_url` settings
have been added so that separate broker URLs can be provided
for connections used for consuming/publishing.

In addition to the configuration options, two new methods have been
added the app API:

    - ``app.connection_for_read()``
    - ``app.connection_for_write()``

These should now be used in place of ``app.connection()`` to specify
the intent of the required connection.

.. note::

    Two connection pools are available: ``app.pool`` (read), and
    ``app.producer_pool`` (write). The latter doesn't actually give connections
    but full :class:`kombu.Producer` instances.

    .. code-block:: python

        def publish_some_message(app, producer=None):
            with app.producer_or_acquire(producer) as producer:
                ...

        def consume_messages(app, connection=None):
            with app.connection_or_acquire(connection) as connection:
                ...

Canvas Refactor
---------------

The canvas/work-flow implementation have been heavily refactored
to fix some long outstanding issues.

.. :sha:`d79dcd8e82c5e41f39abd07ffed81ca58052bcd2`
.. :sha:`1e9dd26592eb2b93f1cb16deb771cfc65ab79612`
.. :sha:`e442df61b2ff1fe855881c1e2ff9acc970090f54`
.. :sha:`0673da5c09ac22bdd49ba811c470b73a036ee776`

- Error callbacks can now take real exception and traceback instances
  (Issue #2538).

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> add.s(2, 2).on_error(log_error.s()).delay()

    Where ``log_error`` could be defined as:

    .. code-block:: python

        @app.task
        def log_error(request, exc, traceback):
            with open(os.path.join('/var/errors', request.id), 'a') as fh:
                print('--\n\n{0} {1} {2}'.format(
                    task_id, exc, traceback), file=fh)

    See :ref:`guide-canvas` for more examples.

- Now unrolls groups within groups into a single group (Issue #1509).
- chunks/map/starmap tasks now routes based on the target task
- chords and chains can now be immutable.
- Fixed bug where serialized signatures weren't converted back into

  argument 'task_id' (Issue #2225).

    Fix contributed by **Aneil Mallavarapu**.

- Fixed issue where the wrong result is returned when a chain
  contains a chord as the penultimate task.

    Fix contributed by **Aneil Mallavarapu**.

- Special case of ``group(A.s() | group(B.s() | C.s()))`` now works.

- Chain: Fixed bug with incorrect id set when a subtask is also a chain.

- ``group | group`` is now flattened into a single group (Issue #2573).

- Fixed issue where ``group | task`` wasn't upgrading correctly
  to chord (Issue #2922).

Amazon SQS transport now officially supported
---------------------------------------------

The SQS broker transport has been rewritten to use async I/O and as such
joins RabbitMQ and Redis as officially supported transports.

The new implementation also takes advantage of long polling,
and closes several issues related to using SQS as a broker.

This work was sponsored by Nextdoor.

New API for configuring periodic tasks
--------------------------------------

This new API enables you to use signatures when defining periodic tasks,
removing the chance of mistyping task names.

An example of the new API is :ref:`here <beat-entries>`.

.. :sha:`bc18d0859c1570f5eb59f5a969d1d32c63af764b`
.. :sha:`132d8d94d38f4050db876f56a841d5a5e487b25b`

Handling task connection errors
-------------------------------

Connection related errors occuring while sending a task is now re-raised
as a :exc:`kombu.exceptions.OperationalError` error:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> try:
    ...     add.delay(2, 2)
    ... except add.OperationalError as exc:
    ...     print('Could not send task %r: %r' % (add, exc))

Prefork: Limit child process resident memory size
-------------------------------------------------
.. :sha:`5cae0e754128750a893524dcba4ae030c414de33`

You can now limit the maximum amount of memory allocated per prefork
pool child process by setting the worker
:option:`--max-memory-per-child <celery worker --max-memory-per-child>` option,
or the :setting:`worker_max_memory_per_child` setting.

The limit is for RSS/resident memory size and is specified in kilobytes.

A child process having exceeded the limit will be terminated and replaced
with a new process after the currently executing task returns.

See :ref:`worker-max-memory-per-child` for more information.

Redis: Result backend optimizations
-----------------------------------

RPC is now using pub/sub for streaming task results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calling ``result.get()`` when using the Redis result backend
used to be extremely expensive as it was using polling to wait
for the result to become available. A default polling
interval of 0.5 seconds didn't help performance, but was
necessary to avoid a spin loop.

The new implementation is using Redis Pub/Sub mechanisms to
publish and retrieve results immediately, greatly improving
task round-trip times.

Contributed by **Yaroslav Zhavoronkov** and **Ask Solem**.

New optimized chord join implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This was an experimental feature introduced in Celery 3.1,
that could only be enabled by adding ``?new_join=1`` to the
result backend URL configuration.

We feel that the implementation has been tested thoroughly enough
to be considered stable and enabled by default.

The new implementation greatly reduces the overhead of chords,
and especially with larger chords the performance benefit can be massive.

New Riak result backend Introduced

New CouchDB result backend introduced
-------------------------------------

See :ref:`conf-couchdb-result-backend` for more information.

Contributed by **Nathan Van Gheem**.

New Consul result backend introduced
------------------------------------

Add support for Consul as a backend using the Key/Value store of Consul.

Consul has an HTTP API where through you can store keys with their values.

The backend extends KeyValueStoreBackend and implements most of the methods.

Mainly to set, get and remove objects.

This allows Celery to store Task results in the K/V store of Consul.

Consul also allows to set a TTL on keys using the Sessions from Consul. This way
the backend supports auto expiry of Task results.

For more information on Consul visit http://consul.io/

The backend uses :pypi:`python-consul` for talking to the HTTP API.
This package is fully Python 3 compliant just as this backend is:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install python-consul

That installs the required package to talk to Consul's HTTP API from Python.

Brand new Cassandra result backend
----------------------------------

A brand new Cassandra backend utilizing the new :pypi:`cassandra-driver`
library is replacing the old result backend using the older
:pypi:`pycassa` library.

See :ref:`conf-cassandra-result-backend` for more information.

Event Batching
--------------

Events are now buffered in the worker and sent as a list, reducing
the overhead required to send monitoring events.

For authors of custom event monitors there will be no action
required as long as you're using the Python Celery
helpers (:class:`~@events.Receiver`) to implement your monitor.

However, if you're parsing raw event messages you must now account
for batched event messages,  as they differ from normal event messages
in the following way:

- The routing key for a batch of event messages will be set to
  ``<event-group>.multi`` where the only batched event group
  is currently ``task`` (giving a routing key of ``task.multi``).

- The message body will be a serialized list-of-dictionaries instead
  of a dictionary. Each item in the list can be regarded
  as a normal event message body.

.. :sha:`03399b4d7c26fb593e61acf34f111b66b340ba4e`

``Task.replace``
----------------

Task.replace changed, removes Task.replace_in_chord.

The two methods had almost the same functionality, but the old
``Task.replace`` would force the new task to inherit the
callbacks/errbacks of the existing task.

If you replace a node in a tree, then you wouldn't expect the new node to
inherit the children of the old node, so this seems like unexpected
behavior.

So ``self.replace(sig)`` now works for any task, in addition ``sig`` can now
be a group.

Groups are automatically converted to a chord, where the callback
will "accumulate" the results of the group tasks.

A new built-in task (`celery.accumulate` was added for this purpose)

Closes #817

Optimized Beat implementation
-----------------------------

The :program:`celery beat` implementation has been optimized
for millions of periodic tasks by using a heap to schedule entries.

Contributed by **Ask Solem** and **Alexander Koshelev**.

Task Auto-retry Decorator
-------------------------

Writing custom retry handling for exception events is so common
that we now have built-in support for it.

For this a new ``autoretry_for`` argument is now supported by
the task decorators, where you can specify a tuple of exceptions
to automatically retry for.

See :ref:`task-autoretry` for more information.

Remote Task Tracebacks
----------------------

The new :setting:`task_remote_tracebacks` will make task tracebacks more
useful by injecting the stack of the remote worker.

This feature requires the additional :pypi:`tblib` library.

Async Result API
----------------

eventlet/gevent drainers, promises, BLA BLA

Closed issue #2529.

RPC Result Backend matured
--------------------------

Lots of bugs in the previously experimental RPC result backend have been fixed
and we now consider it production ready.

Contributed by **Ask Solem**, **Morris Tweed**.

New Task Router API
-------------------

The :setting:`task_routes` setting can now hold functions, and map routes
now support glob patterns and regexes.

Instead of using router classes you can now simply define a function:

.. code-block:: python

    def route_for_task(name, args, kwargs, options, task=None, **kwargs):
        from proj import tasks

        if name == tasks.add.name:
            return {'queue': 'hipri'}

If you don't need the arguments you can use start arguments, just make
sure you always also accept star arguments so that we've the ability
to add more features in the future:

.. code-block:: python

    def route_for_task(name, *args, **kwargs):
        from proj import tasks
        if name == tasks.add.name:
            return {'queue': 'hipri', 'priority': 9}

Both the ``options`` argument and the new ``task`` keyword argument
are new to the function-style routers, and will make it easier to write
routers based on execution options, or properties of the task.

The optional ``task`` keyword argument won't be set if a task is called
by name using :meth:`@send_task`.

For more examples, including using glob/regexes in routers please see
:setting:`task_routes` and :ref:`routing-automatic`.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Now depends on :ref:`Kombu 4.0 <kombu:version-4.0>`.

- Now depends on :pypi:`billiard` version 3.5.

- No longer depends on :pypi:`anyjson`. Good-bye old friend :(


Tasks
~~~~~

- The "anon-exchange" is now used for simple name-name direct routing.

  This increases performance as it completely bypasses the routing table,
  in addition it also improves reliability for the Redis broker transport.

- An empty ResultSet now evaluates to True.

    Fix contributed by **Colin McIntosh**.

- New :setting:`task_reject_on_worker_lost` setting, and
  :attr:`~@Task.reject_on_worker_lost` task attribute decides what happens
  when the child worker process executing a late ack task is terminated.

    Contributed by **Michael Permana**.

- ``Task.subtask`` renamed to ``Task.signature`` with alias.

- ``Task.subtask_from_request`` renamed to
  ``Task.signature_from_request`` with alias.

- The ``delivery_mode`` attribute for :class:`kombu.Queue` is now
  respected (Issue #1953).

- Routes in :setting:`task-routes` can now specify a
  :class:`~kombu.Queue` instance directly.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        task_routes = {'proj.tasks.add': {'queue': Queue('add')}}

- ``AsyncResult`` now raises :exc:`ValueError` if task_id is None.
  (Issue #1996).

        Looks like a task.

    - :class:`~celery.utils.abstract.CallableSignature`

        Looks like a task signature.

- ``Task.replace`` now properly forwards callbacks (Issue #2722).

    Fix contributed by **Nicolas Unravel**.

    Fix contributed by **Feanil Patel**.


Beat
~~~~

- Fixed crontab infinite loop with invalid date.

    When occurrence can never be reached (example, April, 31th), trying
    to reach the next occurrence would trigger an infinite loop.

    Try fixing that by raising a RuntimeError after 2,000 iterations

    (Also added a test for crontab leap years in the process)

    Fix contributed by **Romuald Brunet**.

- Now ensures the program exits with a non-zero exit code when an
  exception terminates the service.

    the :meth:`~@gen_task_name` method.

    Contributed by **Dmitry Malinovsky**.

- App has new ``app.current_worker_task`` property that
  returns the task that's currently being worked on (or :const:`None`).
  (Issue #2100).

Execution Pools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Eventlet/Gevent**: Fixed race condition leading to "simultaneous read"
  errors (Issue #2812).

- **Prefork**: Prefork pool now uses ``poll`` instead of ``select`` where
  available (Issue #2373).

  worker (Issue #2606).

- **Eventlet**: Now returns pool size in :program:`celery inspect stats`
  command.

    Contributed by **Alexander Oblovatniy**.

Transports
~~~~~~~~~~

- **Redis Transport**: The Redis transport now supports the
  :setting:`broker_use_ssl` option.

Programs
~~~~~~~~

- :program:`celery multi`: ``%n`` format for is now synonym with
  ``%N`` to be consistent with :program:`celery worker`.

- :program:`celery inspect`/:program:`celery control`: now supports a new
  :option:`--json <celery inspect --json>` option to give output in json format.

- :program:`celery inspect registered`: now ignores built-in tasks.

- :program:`celery purge` now takes ``-Q`` and ``-X`` options
  used to specify what queues to include and exclude from the purge.

- New :program:`celery logtool`: Utility for filtering and parsing
  celery worker log-files

- :program:`celery multi`: now passes through `%i` and `%I` log
  file formats.

- General: ``%p`` can now be used to expand to the full worker node-name
  in log-file/pid-file arguments.

- A new command line option
   :option:`--executable <celery worker --executable>` is now
   available for daemonizing programs (:program:`celery worker` and
   :program:`celery beat`).

- :program:`celery worker`: supports new
  :option:`--prefetch-multiplier <celery worker --prefetch-multiplier>` option.

    Contributed by **Mickaël Penhard**.

Worker
~~~~~~

- Improvements and fixes for :class:`~celery.utils.collections.LimitedSet`.

    Getting rid of leaking memory + adding ``minlen`` size of the set:
    the minimal residual size of the set after operating for some time.
    ``minlen`` items are kept, even if they should've been expired.

    Problems with older and even more old code:

    #. Heap would tend to grow in some scenarios
       (like adding an item multiple times).

    #. Adding many items fast wouldn't clean them soon enough (if ever).

    #. When talking to other workers, revoked._data was sent, but
       it was processed on the other side as iterable.
       That means giving those keys new (current)
       time-stamp. By doing this workers could recycle
       items forever. Combined with 1) and 2), this means that in
       large set of workers, you're getting out of memory soon.

    All those problems should be fixed now.

    This should fix issues #3095, #3086.

    Contributed by **David Pravec**.

- Worker now only starts the remote control command consumer if the
  broker transport used actually supports them.

- Gossip now sets ``x-message-ttl`` for event queue to heartbeat_interval s.
  (Issue #2005).

- Now preserves exit code (Issue #2024).

- Fixed crash when the ``-purge`` argument was used.

- Log--level for unrecoverable errors changed from ``error`` to
  ``critical``.

- Improved rate limiting accuracy.

- Account for missing timezone information in task expires field.

    Fix contributed by **Albert Wang**.

- The worker no longer has a ``Queues`` bootsteps, as it is now
    superfluous.

- Now emits the "Received task" line even for revoked tasks.
  (Issue #3155).

- Now respects :setting:`broker_connection_retry` setting.

    Fix contributed by **Nat Williams**.

- New :data:`celery.worker.state.requests` enables O(1) loookup
  of active/reserved tasks by id.

- Auto-scale didn't always update keep-alive when scaling down.

  to ensure older event messages are discarded.

    The default is 5 seconds, but can be changed using the
    :setting:`event_queue_ttl` setting.

- Event monitors now sets the :setting:`event_queue_expires`
  setting by default.

    The queues will now expire after 60 seconds after the monitor stops
    consuming from it.

Reorganization, Deprecations, and Removals
==========================================

Incompatible changes
--------------------

- Prefork: Calling ``result.get()`` or joining any result from within a task
  now raises :exc:`RuntimeError`.

    In previous versions this would emit a warning.

- :mod:`celery.worker.consumer` is now a package, not a module.

- Module ``celery.worker.job`` renamed to :mod:`celery.worker.request`.

- Beat: ``Scheduler.Publisher``/``.publisher`` renamed to
  ``.Producer``/``.producer``.

- Result: The task_name argument/attribute of :class:`@AsyncResult` was
  removed.

    This was historically a field used for :mod:`pickle` compatibility,
    but is no longer needed.

- Backends: Arguments named ``status`` renamed to ``state``.

- Backends: ``backend.get_status()`` renamed to ``backend.get_state()``.

.. _v400-unscheduled-removals:

Unscheduled Removals
--------------------

- The experimental :mod:`celery.contrib.methods` feature has been removed,
  as there were far many bugs in the implementation to be useful.

- The CentOS init-scripts have been removed.

    These didn't really add any features over the generic init-scripts,
    so you're encouraged to use them instead, or something like
    :pypi:`supervisor`.


.. _v400-deprecations-reorg:

Reorganization Deprecations
---------------------------

These symbols have been renamed, and while there's an alias available in this
version for backward compatibility, they will be removed in Celery 5.0, so
make sure you rename these ASAP to make sure it won't break for that release.

Chances are that you'll only use the first in this list, but you never
know:

- ``celery.utils.worker_direct`` ->
  :meth:`celery.utils.nodenames.worker_direct`.

- ``celery.utils.nodename`` -> :meth:`celery.utils.nodenames.nodename`.

- ``celery.utils.anon_nodename`` ->
  :meth:`celery.utils.nodenames.anon_nodename`.

- ``celery.utils.nodesplit`` -> :meth:`celery.utils.nodenames.nodesplit`.

- ``celery.utils.default_nodename`` ->
  :meth:`celery.utils.nodenames.default_nodename`.

- ``celery.utils.node_format`` -> :meth:`celery.utils.nodenames.node_format`.

- ``celery.utils.host_format`` -> :meth:`celery.utils.nodenames.host_format`.

.. _v400-removals:

Scheduled Removals
------------------

Modules
~~~~~~~

- Module ``celery.worker.job`` has been renamed to :mod:`celery.worker.request`.

    This was an internal module so shouldn't have any effect.
    It's now part of the public API so must not change again.

- Module ``celery.task.trace`` has been renamed to ``celery.app.trace``
  as the ``celery.task`` package is being phased out. The module
  will be removed in version 5.0 so please change any import from::

    from celery.task.trace import X

  to::

    from celery.app.trace import X

- Old compatibility aliases in the :mod:`celery.loaders` module
  has been removed.

    - Removed ``celery.loaders.current_loader()``, use: ``current_app.loader``

    - Removed ``celery.loaders.load_settings()``, use: ``current_app.conf``

Result
~~~~~~

- ``AsyncResult.serializable()`` and ``celery.result.from_serializable``
    has been removed:

    Use instead:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> tup = result.as_tuple()
        >>> from celery.result import result_from_tuple
        >>> result = result_from_tuple(tup)

- Removed ``BaseAsyncResult``, use ``AsyncResult`` for instance checks
  instead.

- Removed ``TaskSetResult``, use ``GroupResult`` instead.

    - ``TaskSetResult.total`` -> ``len(GroupResult)``

    - ``TaskSetResult.taskset_id`` -> ``GroupResult.id``

- Removed ``ResultSet.subtasks``, use ``ResultSet.results`` instead.


TaskSet
~~~~~~~

TaskSet has been renamed to group and TaskSet will be removed in version 4.0.

Old::

    >>> from celery.task import TaskSet

    >>> TaskSet(add.subtask((i, i)) for i in xrange(10)).apply_async()

New::

    >>> from celery import group
    >>> group(add.s(i, i) for i in xrange(10))()

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for the very old magic keyword arguments accepted by tasks is
finally removed in this version.

If you're still using these you have to rewrite any task still
using the old ``celery.decorators`` module and depending
on keyword arguments being passed to the task,
for example::

    from celery.decorators import task

    @task()
    def add(x, y, task_id=None):
        print('My task id is %r' % (task_id,))

should be rewritten into::

    from celery import task

    @task(bind=True)
    def add(self, x, y):
        print('My task id is {0.request.id}'.format(self))
