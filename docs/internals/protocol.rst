* eta
    `string` (ISO 8601)

    Estimated time of arrival. This is the date and time in ISO 8601
    format. If not provided the message is not scheduled, but will be
    executed asap.

    `string` (ISO 8601)

    Expiration date. This is the date and time in ISO 8601 format.
    If not provided the message will never expire. The message
    will be expired when the message is received and the expiration date
    has been exceeded.


Extensions
==========

Extensions are additional keys in the message body that the worker may or
may not support.  If the worker finds an extension key it doesn't support
it should optimally reject the message so another worker gets a chance
to process it.


* taskset_id

  The taskset this task is part of.

* chord

  Siginifies that this task is one of the header parts of a chord.  The value
  of this key is the body of the cord that should be executed when all of
  the tasks in the header has returned.
