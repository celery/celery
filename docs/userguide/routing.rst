Basics
======

.. _routing-automatic:

Automatic routing
-----------------

The simplest way to do routing is to use the
:setting:`task_create_missing_queues` setting (on by default).

With this setting on, a named queue that's not already defined in
:setting:`task_queues` will be created automatically. This makes it easy to
perform simple routing tasks.

Say you have two servers, `x`, and `y` that handle regular tasks,
and one server `z`, that only handles feed related tasks. You can use this
configuration::

    task_routes = {'feed.tasks.import_feed': {'queue': 'feeds'}}

With this route enabled import feed tasks will be routed to the
`"feeds"` queue, while all other tasks will be routed to the default queue
(named `"celery"` for historical reasons).

Alternatively, you can use glob pattern matching, or even regular expressions,
to match all tasks in the ``feed.tasks`` name-space:

.. code-block:: python

    app.conf.task_routes = {'feed.tasks.*': {'queue': 'feeds'}}

If the order of matching patterns is important you should
specify the router in *items* format instead:

.. code-block:: python

    task_routes = ([
        ('feed.tasks.*', {'queue': 'feeds'}),
        ('web.tasks.*', {'queue': 'web'}),
        (re.compile(r'(video|image)\.tasks\..*'), {'queue': 'media'}),
    ],)

.. note::

    The :setting:`task_routes` setting can either be a dictionary, or a
    list of router objects, so in this case we need to specify the setting
    as a tuple containing a list.

After installing the router, you can start server `z` to only process the feeds
queue like this:

.. code-block:: console

    user@z:/$ celery -A proj worker -Q feeds

You can specify as many queues as you want, so you can make this server
process the default queue as well:

.. code-block:: console

    user@z:/$ celery -A proj worker -Q feeds,celery

.. _routing-changing-default-queue:

Changing the name of the default queue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can change the name of the default queue by using the following
configuration:

.. code-block:: python

    app.conf.task_default_queue = 'default'

.. _routing-autoqueue-details:

How the queues are defined
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The point with this feature is to hide the complex AMQP protocol for users
with only basic needs. However -- you may still be interested in how these queues
are declared.

A queue named `"video"` will be created with the following settings:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {'exchange': 'video',
     'exchange_type': 'direct',
     'routing_key': 'video'}

The non-AMQP backends like `Redis` or `SQS` don't support exchanges,
so they require the exchange to have the same name as the queue. Using this
design ensures it will work for them as well.

.. _routing-manual:

Manual routing
--------------

Say you have two servers, `x`, and `y` that handle regular tasks,
and one server `z`, that only handles feed related tasks, you can use this
configuration:

.. code-block:: python

    from kombu import Queue

    app.conf.task_default_queue = 'default'
    app.conf.task_queues = (
        Queue('default',    routing_key='task.#'),
        Queue('feed_tasks', routing_key='feed.#'),
    )
    app.conf.task_default_exchange = 'tasks'
    app.conf.task_default_exchange_type = 'topic'
    app.conf.task_default_routing_key = 'task.default'

:setting:`task_queues` is a list of :class:`~kombu.entity.Queue`
instances.
If you don't set the exchange or exchange type values for a key, these
will be taken from the :setting:`task_default_exchange` and
:setting:`task_default_exchange_type` settings.

To route a task to the `feed_tasks` queue, you can add an entry in the
:setting:`task_routes` setting:

.. code-block:: python

    task_routes = {
            'feeds.tasks.import_feed': {
                'queue': 'feed_tasks',
                'routing_key': 'feed.import',
            },
    }


You can also override this using the `routing_key` argument to
:meth:`Task.apply_async`, or :func:`~celery.execute.send_task`:

    >>> from feeds.tasks import import_feed
    >>> import_feed.apply_async(args=['http://cnn.com/rss'],
    ...                         queue='feed_tasks',
    ...                         routing_key='feed.import')


To make server `z` consume from the feed queue exclusively you can
start it with the :option:`celery worker -Q` option:

.. code-block:: console

    user@z:/$ celery -A proj worker -Q feed_tasks --hostname=z@%h

Servers `x` and `y` must be configured to consume from the default queue:

.. code-block:: console

    user@x:/$ celery -A proj worker -Q default --hostname=x@%h
    user@y:/$ celery -A proj worker -Q default --hostname=y@%h

If you want, you can even have your feed processing worker handle regular
tasks as well, maybe in times when there's a lot of work to do:

.. code-block:: console

    user@z:/$ celery -A proj worker -Q feed_tasks,default --hostname=z@%h

If you have another queue but on another exchange you want to add,
just specify a custom exchange and exchange type:

.. code-block:: python

    from kombu import Exchange, Queue

    app.conf.task_queues = (
        Queue('feed_tasks',    routing_key='feed.#'),
        Queue('regular_tasks', routing_key='task.#'),
        Queue('image_tasks',   exchange=Exchange('mediatasks', type='direct'),
                               routing_key='image.compress'),
    )

If you're confused about these terms, you should read up on AMQP.

Special Routing Options
=======================

.. _routing-options-rabbitmq-priorities:

RabbitMQ Message Priorities
---------------------------
:supported transports: RabbitMQ

.. versionadded:: 4.0

Queues can be configured to support priorities by setting the
``x-max-priority`` argument:

.. code-block:: python

    from kombu import Exchange, Queue

    app.conf.task_queues = [
        Queue('tasks', Exchange('tasks'), routing_key='tasks',
              queue_arguments={'x-max-priority': 10}),
    ]

A default value for all queues can be set using the
:setting:`task_queue_max_priority` setting:

.. code-block:: python

    app.conf.task_queue_max_priority = 10

A default priority for all tasks can also be specified using the
:setting:`task_default_priority` setting:

.. code-block:: python

    app.conf.task_default_priority = 5

.. _amqp-primer:


Redis Message Priorities
------------------------
:supported transports: Redis

While the Celery Redis transport does honor the priority field, Redis itself has
no notion of priorities. Please read this note before attempting to implement
priorities with Redis as you may experience some unexpected behavior.

To start scheduling tasks based on priorities you need to configure queue_order_strategy transport option.

.. code-block:: python

    app.conf.broker_transport_options = {
        'queue_order_strategy': 'priority',
    }


The priority support is implemented by creating n lists for each queue.
This means that even though there are 10 (0-9) priority levels, these are
consolidated into 4 levels by default to save resources. This means that a
queue named celery will really be split into 4 queues:

.. code-block:: python

    ['celery0', 'celery3', 'celery6', 'celery9']


If you want more priority levels you can set the priority_steps transport option:

.. code-block:: python

    app.conf.broker_transport_options = {
        'priority_steps': list(range(10)),
        'queue_order_strategy': 'priority',
    }


That said, note that this will never be as good as priorities implemented at the
server level, and may be approximate at best. But it may still be good enough
for your application.


AMQP Primer
===========

Messages
--------

A message consists of headers and a body. Celery uses headers to store
the content type of the message and its content encoding. The
content type is usually the serialization format used to serialize the
message. The body contains the name of the task to execute, the
task id (UUID), the arguments to apply it with and some additional
meta-data -- like the number of retries or an ETA.

This is an example task message represented as a Python dictionary:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {'task': 'myapp.tasks.add',
     'id': '54086c5e-6193-4575-8308-dbab76798756',
     'args': [4, 4],
     'kwargs': {}}

.. _amqp-producers-consumers-brokers:

Producers, consumers, and brokers
---------------------------------

The client sending messages is typically called a *publisher*, or
a *producer*, while the entity receiving messages is called
a *consumer*.

The *broker* is the message server, routing messages from producers
to consumers.

You're likely to see these terms used a lot in AMQP related material.

.. _amqp-exchanges-queues-keys:

Exchanges, queues, and routing keys
-----------------------------------

1. Messages are sent to exchanges.
2. An exchange routes messages to one or more queues. Several exchange types
   exists, providing different ways to do routing, or implementing
   different messaging scenarios.
3. The message waits in the queue until someone consumes it.
4. The message is deleted from the queue when it has been acknowledged.

The steps required to send and receive messages are:

1. Create an exchange
2. Create a queue
3. Bind the queue to the exchange.

Celery automatically creates the entities necessary for the queues in
:setting:`task_queues` to work (except if the queue's `auto_declare`
setting is set to :const:`False`).

Here's an example queue configuration with three queues;
One for video, one for images, and one default queue for everything else:

.. code-block:: python

    from kombu import Exchange, Queue

    app.conf.task_queues = (
        Queue('default', Exchange('default'), routing_key='default'),
        Queue('videos',  Exchange('media'),   routing_key='media.video'),
        Queue('images',  Exchange('media'),   routing_key='media.image'),
    )
    app.conf.task_default_queue = 'default'
    app.conf.task_default_exchange_type = 'direct'
    app.conf.task_default_routing_key = 'default'

.. _amqp-exchange-types:

Exchange types
--------------

The exchange type defines how the messages are routed through the exchange.
The exchange types defined in the standard are `direct`, `topic`,
`fanout` and `headers`. Also non-standard exchange types are available
as plug-ins to RabbitMQ, like the `last-value-cache plug-in`_ by Michael
Bridgen.

.. _`last-value-cache plug-in`:
    https://github.com/squaremo/rabbitmq-lvc-plugin

.. _amqp-exchange-type-direct:

Direct exchanges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Direct exchanges match by exact routing keys, so a queue bound by
the routing key `video` only receives messages with that routing key.

.. _amqp-exchange-type-topic:

Topic exchanges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Topic exchanges matches routing keys using dot-separated words, and the
wild-card characters: ``*`` (matches a single word), and ``#`` (matches
zero or more words).

With routing keys like ``usa.news``, ``usa.weather``, ``norway.news``, and
``norway.weather``, bindings could be ``*.news`` (all news), ``usa.#`` (all
items in the USA), or ``usa.weather`` (all USA weather items).

.. _amqp-api:

Related API commands
--------------------

.. method:: exchange.declare(exchange_name, type, passive,
                             durable, auto_delete, internal)

    Declares an exchange by name.

    See :meth:`amqp:Channel.exchange_declare <amqp.channel.Channel.exchange_declare>`.

    :keyword passive: Passive means the exchange won't be created, but you
        can use this to check if the exchange already exists.

    :keyword durable: Durable exchanges are persistent (i.e., they survive
        a broker restart).

    :keyword auto_delete: This means the exchange will be deleted by the broker
        when there are no more queues using it.


.. method:: queue.declare(queue_name, passive, durable, exclusive, auto_delete)

    Declares a queue by name.

    See :meth:`amqp:Channel.queue_declare <amqp.channel.Channel.queue_declare>`

    Exclusive queues can only be consumed from by the current connection.
    Exclusive also implies `auto_delete`.

.. method:: queue.bind(queue_name, exchange_name, routing_key)

    Binds a queue to an exchange with a routing key.

    Unbound queues won't receive messages, so this is necessary.

    See :meth:`amqp:Channel.queue_bind <amqp.channel.Channel.queue_bind>`

.. method:: queue.delete(name, if_unused=False, if_empty=False)

    Deletes a queue and its binding.

    See :meth:`amqp:Channel.queue_delete <amqp.channel.Channel.queue_delete>`

.. method:: exchange.delete(name, if_unused=False)

    Deletes an exchange.

    See :meth:`amqp:Channel.exchange_delete <amqp.channel.Channel.exchange_delete>`

.. note::

    Declaring doesn't necessarily mean "create". When you declare you
    *assert* that the entity exists and that it's operable. There's no
    rule as to whom should initially create the exchange/queue/binding,
    whether consumer or producer. Usually the first one to need it will
    be the one to create it.

.. _amqp-api-hands-on:

Hands-on with the API
---------------------

Celery comes with a tool called :program:`celery amqp`
that's used for command line access to the AMQP API, enabling access to
administration tasks like creating/deleting queues and exchanges, purging
queues or sending messages. It can also be used for non-AMQP brokers,
but different implementation may not implement all commands.

You can write commands directly in the arguments to :program:`celery amqp`,
or just start with no arguments to start it in shell-mode:

.. code-block:: console

    $ celery -A proj amqp
    -> connecting to amqp://guest@localhost:5672/.
    -> connected.
    1>

Here ``1>`` is the prompt. The number 1, is the number of commands you
have executed so far. Type ``help`` for a list of commands available.
It also supports auto-completion, so you can start typing a command and then
hit the `tab` key to show a list of possible matches.

Let's create a queue you can send messages to:

.. code-block:: console

    $ celery -A proj amqp
    1> exchange.declare testexchange direct
    ok.
    2> queue.declare testqueue
    ok. queue:testqueue messages:0 consumers:0.
    3> queue.bind testqueue testexchange testkey
    ok.

This created the direct exchange ``testexchange``, and a queue
named ``testqueue``. The queue is bound to the exchange using
the routing key ``testkey``.

From now on all messages sent to the exchange ``testexchange`` with routing
key ``testkey`` will be moved to this queue. You can send a message by
using the ``basic.publish`` command:

.. code-block:: console

    4> basic.publish 'This is a message!' testexchange testkey
    ok.

Now that the message is sent you can retrieve it again. You can use the
``basic.get`` command here, that polls for new messages on the queue
in a synchronous manner
(this is OK for maintenance tasks, but for services you want to use
``basic.consume`` instead)

Pop a message off the queue:

.. code-block:: console

    5> basic.get testqueue
    {'body': 'This is a message!',
     'delivery_info': {'delivery_tag': 1,
                       'exchange': u'testexchange',
                       'message_count': 0,
                       'redelivered': False,
                       'routing_key': u'testkey'},
     'properties': {}}


AMQP uses acknowledgment to signify that a message has been received
and processed successfully. If the message hasn't been acknowledged
and consumer channel is closed, the message will be delivered to
another consumer.

Note the delivery tag listed in the structure above; Within a connection
channel, every received message has a unique delivery tag,
This tag is used to acknowledge the message. Also note that
delivery tags aren't unique across connections, so in another client
the delivery tag `1` might point to a different message than in this channel.

You can acknowledge the message you received using ``basic.ack``:

.. code-block:: console

    6> basic.ack 1
    ok.

To clean up after our test session you should delete the entities you created:

.. code-block:: console

    7> queue.delete testqueue
    ok. 0 messages deleted.
    8> exchange.delete testexchange
    ok.


.. _routing-tasks:

Routing Tasks
=============

.. _routing-defining-queues:

Defining queues
---------------

In Celery available queues are defined by the :setting:`task_queues` setting.

Here's an example queue configuration with three queues;
One for video, one for images, and one default queue for everything else:

.. code-block:: python

    default_exchange = Exchange('default', type='direct')
    media_exchange = Exchange('media', type='direct')

    app.conf.task_queues = (
        Queue('default', default_exchange, routing_key='default'),
        Queue('videos', media_exchange, routing_key='media.video'),
        Queue('images', media_exchange, routing_key='media.image')
    )
    app.conf.task_default_queue = 'default'
    app.conf.task_default_exchange = 'default'
    app.conf.task_default_routing_key = 'default'

Here, the :setting:`task_default_queue` will be used to route tasks that
doesn't have an explicit route.

The default exchange, exchange type, and routing key will be used as the
default routing values for tasks, and as the default values for entries
in :setting:`task_queues`.

Multiple bindings to a single queue are also supported.  Here's an example
of two routing keys that are both bound to the same queue:

.. code-block:: python

    from kombu import Exchange, Queue, binding

    media_exchange = Exchange('media', type='direct')

    CELERY_QUEUES = (
        Queue('media', [
            binding(media_exchange, routing_key='media.video'),
            binding(media_exchange, routing_key='media.image'),
        ]),
    )


.. _routing-task-destination:

Specifying task destination
---------------------------

The destination for a task is decided by the following (in order):

1. The routing arguments to :func:`Task.apply_async`.
2. Routing related attributes defined on the :class:`~celery.task.base.Task`
   itself.
3. The :ref:`routers` defined in :setting:`task_routes`.

It's considered best practice to not hard-code these settings, but rather
leave that as configuration options by using :ref:`routers`;
This is the most flexible approach, but sensible defaults can still be set
as task attributes.

.. _routers:

Routers
-------

A router is a function that decides the routing options for a task.

All you need to define a new router is to define a function with
the signature ``(name, args, kwargs, options, task=None, **kw)``:

.. code-block:: python

    def route_task(name, args, kwargs, options, task=None, **kw):
            if name == 'myapp.tasks.compress_video':
                return {'exchange': 'video',
                        'exchange_type': 'topic',
                        'routing_key': 'video.compress'}

If you return the ``queue`` key, it'll expand with the defined settings of
that queue in :setting:`task_queues`:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {'queue': 'video', 'routing_key': 'video.compress'}

becomes -->

.. code-block:: javascript

        {'queue': 'video',
         'exchange': 'video',
         'exchange_type': 'topic',
         'routing_key': 'video.compress'}


You install router classes by adding them to the :setting:`task_routes`
setting:

.. code-block:: python

    task_routes = (route_task,)

Router functions can also be added by name:

.. code-block:: python

    task_routes = ('myapp.routers.route_task',)


For simple task name -> route mappings like the router example above,
you can simply drop a dict into :setting:`task_routes` to get the
same behavior:

.. code-block:: python

    task_routes = {
        'myapp.tasks.compress_video': {
            'queue': 'video',
            'routing_key': 'video.compress',
        },
    }

The routers will then be traversed in order, it will stop at the first router
returning a true value, and use that as the final route for the task.

You can also have multiple routers defined in a sequence:

.. code-block:: python

    task_routes = [
        route_task,
        {
            'myapp.tasks.compress_video': {
                'queue': 'video',
                'routing_key': 'video.compress',
        },
    ]

The routers will then be visited in turn, and the first to return
a value will be chosen.

If you\'re using Redis or RabbitMQ you can also specify the queue\'s default priority
in the route.

.. code-block:: python

    task_routes = {
        'myapp.tasks.compress_video': {
            'queue': 'video',
            'routing_key': 'video.compress',
            'priority': 10,
        },
    }


Similarly, calling `apply_async` on a task will override that
default priority.

.. code-block:: python

    task.apply_async(priority=0)


.. admonition:: Priority Order and Cluster Responsiveness

    It is important to note that, due to worker prefetching, if a bunch of tasks
    submitted at the same time they may be out of priority order at first.
    Disabling worker prefetching will prevent this issue, but may cause less than
    ideal performance for small, fast tasks. In most cases, simply reducing
    `worker_prefetch_multiplier` to 1 is an easier and cleaner way to increase the
    responsiveness of your system without the costs of disabling prefetching
    entirely.

    Note that priorities values are sorted in reverse when
    using the redis broker: 0 being highest priority.


Broadcast
---------

Celery can also support broadcast routing.
Here is an example exchange ``broadcast_tasks`` that delivers
copies of tasks to all workers connected to it:

.. code-block:: python

    from kombu.common import Broadcast

    app.conf.task_queues = (Broadcast('broadcast_tasks'),)
    app.conf.task_routes = {
        'tasks.reload_cache': {
            'queue': 'broadcast_tasks',
            'exchange': 'broadcast_tasks'
        }
    }

Now the ``tasks.reload_cache`` task will be sent to every
worker consuming from this queue.

Here is another example of broadcast routing, this time with
a :program:`celery beat` schedule:

.. code-block:: python

    from kombu.common import Broadcast
    from celery.schedules import crontab

    app.conf.task_queues = (Broadcast('broadcast_tasks'),)

    app.conf.beat_schedule = {
        'test-task': {
            'task': 'tasks.reload_cache',
            'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour='*/3'),
            'options': {'exchange': 'broadcast_tasks'}
        },
    }


.. admonition:: Broadcast & Results

    Note that Celery result doesn't define what happens if two
    tasks have the same task_id. If the same task is distributed to more
    than one worker, then the state history may not be preserved.

    It's a good idea to set the ``task.ignore_result`` attribute in
    this case.
