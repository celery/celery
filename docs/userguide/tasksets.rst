Subtasks
========

.. versionadded:: 2.0

The :class:`~celery.task.sets.subtask` type is used to wrap the arguments and
execution options for a single task invocation::

    subtask(task_name_or_cls, args, kwargs, options)

For convenience every task also has a shortcut to create subtasks::

    task.subtask(args, kwargs, options)

:class:`~celery.task.sets.subtask` is actually a :class:`dict` subclass,
which means it can be serialized with JSON or other encodings that doesn't
support complex Python objects.

Also it can be regarded as a type, as the following usage works::

    >>> s = subtask("tasks.add", args=(2, 2), kwargs={})

    >>> subtask(dict(s))  # coerce dict into subtask

This makes it excellent as a means to pass callbacks around to tasks.

.. _sets-callbacks:

Callbacks
---------

Let's improve our `add` task so it can accept a callback that
takes the result as an argument::

    from celery.task import task
    from celery.task.sets import subtask

    @task
    def add(x, y, callback=None):
        result = x + y
        if callback is not None:
            subtask(callback).delay(result)
        return result

:class:`~celery.task.sets.subtask` also knows how it should be applied,
asynchronously by :meth:`~celery.task.sets.subtask.delay`, and
eagerly by :meth:`~celery.task.sets.subtask.apply`.

The best thing is that any arguments you add to `subtask.delay`,
will be prepended to the arguments specified by the subtask itself!

If you have the subtask::

    >>> add.subtask(args=(10, ))

`subtask.delay(result)` becomes::

    >>> add.apply_async(args=(result, 10))

...

Now let's execute our new `add` task with a callback::

    >>> add.delay(2, 2, callback=add.subtask((8, )))

As expected this will first launch one task calculating :math:`2 + 2`, then
another task calculating :math:`4 + 8`.

.. _sets-taskset:

Task Sets
=========

The :class:`~celery.task.sets.TaskSet` enables easy invocation of several
tasks at once, and is then able to join the results in the same order as the
tasks were invoked.

A task set takes a list of :class:`~celery.task.sets.subtask`'s::

    >>> from celery.task.sets import TaskSet
    >>> from tasks import add

    >>> job = TaskSet(tasks=[
    ...             add.subtask((4, 4)),
    ...             add.subtask((8, 8)),
    ...             add.subtask((16, 16)),
    ...             add.subtask((32, 32)),
    ... ])

    >>> result = job.apply_async()

    >>> result.ready()  # have all subtasks completed?
    True
    >>> result.successful() # were all subtasks successful?
    True
    >>> result.join()
    [4, 8, 16, 32, 64]

.. _sets-results:

Results
-------

When a  :class:`~celery.task.sets.TaskSet` is applied it returns a
:class:`~celery.result.TaskSetResult` object.

:class:`~celery.result.TaskSetResult` takes a list of
:class:`~celery.result.AsyncResult` instances and operates on them as if it was a
single task.

It supports the following operations:

* :meth:`~celery.result.TaskSetResult.successful`

    Returns :const:`True` if all of the subtasks finished
    successfully (e.g. did not raise an exception).

* :meth:`~celery.result.TaskSetResult.failed`

    Returns :const:`True` if any of the subtasks failed.

* :meth:`~celery.result.TaskSetResult.waiting`

    Returns :const:`True` if any of the subtasks
    is not ready yet.

* :meth:`~celery.result.TaskSetResult.ready`

    Return :const:`True` if all of the subtasks
    are ready.

* :meth:`~celery.result.TaskSetResult.completed_count`

    Returns the number of completed subtasks.

* :meth:`~celery.result.TaskSetResult.revoke`

    Revokes all of the subtasks.

* :meth:`~celery.result.TaskSetResult.iterate`

    Iterates over the return values of the subtasks
    as they finish, one by one.

* :meth:`~celery.result.TaskSetResult.join`

    Gather the results for all of the subtasks
    and return a list with them ordered by the order of which they
    were called.

.. _chords:

Chords
======

.. versionadded:: 2.3

A chord is a task that only executes after all of the tasks in a taskset has
finished executing.


Let's calculate the sum of the expression
:math:`1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 ... n + n` up to a hundred digits.

First we need two tasks, :func:`add` and :func:`tsum` (:func:`sum` is
already a standard function):

.. code-block:: python

    from celery.task import task

    @task
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

    @task
    def tsum(numbers):
        return sum(numbers)


Now we can use a chord to calculate each addition step in parallel, and then
get the sum of the resulting numbers::

    >>> from celery.task import chord
    >>> from tasks import add, tsum

    >>> chord(add.subtask((i, i))
    ...     for i in xrange(100))(tsum.subtask()).get()
    9900


This is obviously a very contrived example, the overhead of messaging and
synchronization makes this a lot slower than its Python counterpart::

    sum(i + i for i in xrange(100))

The synchronization step is costly, so you should avoid using chords as much
as possible. Still, the chord is a powerful primitive to have in your toolbox
as synchronization is a required step for many parallel algorithms.

Let's break the chord expression down::

    >>> callback = tsum.subtask()
    >>> header = [add.subtask((i, i)) for i in xrange(100)]
    >>> result = chord(header)(callback)
    >>> result.get()
    9900

Remember, the callback can only be executed after all of the tasks in the
header has returned.  Each step in the header is executed as a task, in
parallel, possibly on different nodes.  The callback is then applied with
the return value of each task in the header.  The task id returned by
:meth:`chord` is the id of the callback, so you can wait for it to complete
and get the final return value (but remember to :ref:`never have a task wait
for other tasks <task-synchronous-subtasks>`)

.. _chord-important-notes:

Important Notes
---------------

By default the synchronization step is implemented by having a recurring task
poll the completion of the taskset every second, applying the subtask when
ready.

Example implementation:

.. code-block:: python

    def unlock_chord(taskset, callback, interval=1, max_retries=None):
        if taskset.ready():
            return subtask(callback).delay(taskset.join())
        unlock_chord.retry(countdown=interval, max_retries=max_retries)


This is used by all result backends except Redis, which increments a
counter after each task in the header, then applying the callback when the
counter exceeds the number of tasks in the set. *Note:* chords do not properly
work with Redis before version 2.2; you will need to upgrade to at least 2.2 to
use them.

The Redis approach is a much better solution, but not easily implemented
in other backends (suggestions welcome!).


.. note::

    If you are using chords with the Redis result backend and also overriding
    the :meth:`Task.after_return` method, you need to make sure to call the
    super method or else the chord callback will not be applied.

    .. code-block:: python

        def after_return(self, *args, **kwargs):
            do_something()
            super(MyTask, self).after_return(*args, **kwargs)
