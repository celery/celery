Introduction
============

There are several tools available to monitor and inspect Celery clusters.

This document describes some of these, as as well as
features related to monitoring, like events and broadcast commands.

.. _monitoring-workers:

Workers
=======

.. _monitoring-control:

Management Command-line Utilities (``inspect``/``control``)
-----------------------------------------------------------


:program:`celery` can also be used to inspect
and manage worker nodes (and to some degree tasks).

To list all the commands available do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ celery help

or to get help for a specific command do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ celery <command> --help

Commands
~~~~~~~~

* **shell**: Drop into a Python shell.

  The locals will include the ``celery`` variable, which is the current app.
  Also all known tasks will be automatically added to locals (unless the
  ``--without-tasks`` flag is set).

  Uses Ipython, bpython, or regular python in that order if installed.
  You can force an implementation using ``--force-ipython|-I``,
  ``--force-bpython|-B``, or ``--force-python|-P``.

* **status**: List active nodes in this cluster

    .. code-block:: bash

            $ celery -A proj status

* **result**: Show the result of a task

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ celery -A proj result -t tasks.add 4e196aa4-0141-4601-8138-7aa33db0f577

    Note that you can omit the name of the task as long as the
    task doesn't use a custom result backend.

* **purge**: Purge messages from all configured task queues.

    .. warning::
        There is no undo for this operation, and messages will
        be permanently deleted!

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ celery -A proj purge


* **inspect active**: List active tasks

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ celery -A proj inspect active

    These are all the tasks that are currently being executed.

* **inspect scheduled**: List scheduled ETA tasks

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ celery -A proj inspect scheduled

    These are tasks reserved by the worker because they have the
    `eta` or `countdown` argument set.

* **inspect reserved**: List reserved tasks

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ celery -A proj inspect reserved

    This will list all tasks that have been prefetched by the worker,
    and is currently waiting to be executed (does not include tasks
    with an eta).

* **inspect revoked**: List history of revoked tasks

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ celery -A proj inspect revoked

* **inspect registered**: List registered tasks

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ celery -A proj inspect registered

* **inspect stats**: Show worker statistics (see :ref:`worker-statistics`)

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ celery -A proj inspect stats

* **control enable_events**: Enable events

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ celery -A proj control enable_events

* **control disable_events**: Disable events

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ celery -A proj control disable_events

* **migrate**: Migrate tasks from one broker to another (**EXPERIMENTAL**).

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ celery -A proj migrate redis://localhost amqp://localhost

  This command will migrate all the tasks on one broker to another.
  As this command is new and experimental you should be sure to have
  a backup of the data before proceeding.

.. note::

    All ``inspect`` and ``control`` commands supports a ``--timeout`` argument,
    This is the number of seconds to wait for responses.
    You may have to increase this timeout if you're not getting a response
    due to latency.

.. _inspect-destination:

Specifying destination nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the inspect and control commands operates on all workers.
You can specify a single, or a list of workers by using the
`--destination` argument:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ celery -A proj inspect -d w1,w2 reserved

    $ celery -A proj control -d w1,w2 enable_events


.. _monitoring-flower:

Flower: Real-time Celery web-monitor
------------------------------------

Flower is a real-time web based monitor and administration tool for Celery.
It is under active development, but is already an essential tool.
Being the recommended monitor for Celery, it obsoletes the Django-Admin
monitor, celerymon and the ncurses based monitor.

Flower is pronounced like "flow", but you can also use the botanical version
if you prefer.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Real-time monitoring using Celery Events

    - Task progress and history.
    - Ability to show task details (arguments, start time, runtime, and more)
    - Graphs and statistics

- Remote Control

    - View worker status and statistics.
    - Shutdown and restart worker instances.
    - Control worker pool size and autoscale settings.
    - View and modify the queues a worker instance consumes from.
    - View currently running tasks
    - View scheduled tasks (ETA/countdown)
    - View reserved and revoked tasks
    - Apply time and rate limits
    - Configuration viewer
    - Revoke or terminate tasks

- HTTP API
- OpenID authentication

.. _screenshots: https://github.com/mher/flower/tree/master/docs/screenshots

Usage
~~~~~

You can use pip to install Flower:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install flower

Running the flower command will start a web-server that you can visit:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ celery -A proj flower

The default port is http://localhost:5555, but you can change this using the `--port` argument:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ celery -A proj flower --port=5555

Broker URL can also be passed through the `--broker` argument :

.. code-block:: bash

    $ celery flower --broker=amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//
    or
    $ celery flower --broker=redis://guest:guest@localhost:6379/0

Then, you can visit flower in your web browser :

.. code-block:: bash

    $ open http://localhost:5555



.. _monitoring-celeryev:

celery events: Curses Monitor
-----------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.0

`celery events` is a simple curses monitor displaying
task and worker history.  You can inspect the result and traceback of tasks,
and it also supports some management commands like rate limiting and shutting
down workers.  This monitor was started as a proof of concept, and you
probably want to use Flower instead.

Starting:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ celery -A proj events

You should see a screen like:

.. figure:: ../images/celeryevshotsm.jpg


`celery events` is also used to start snapshot cameras (see
:ref:`monitoring-snapshots`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ celery -A proj events --camera=<camera-class> --frequency=1.0

and it includes a tool to dump events to :file:`stdout`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ celery -A proj events --dump

For a complete list of options use ``--help``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ celery events --help

.. _`celerymon`: http://github.com/celery/celerymon/

.. _monitoring-rabbitmq:

RabbitMQ
========

To manage a Celery cluster it is important to know how
RabbitMQ can be monitored.

RabbitMQ ships with the `rabbitmqctl(1)`_ command,
with this you can list queues, exchanges, bindings,
queue lengths, the memory usage of each queue, as well
as manage users, virtual hosts and their permissions.

.. note::

    The default virtual host (``"/"``) is used in these
    examples, if you use a custom virtual host you have to add
    the ``-p`` argument to the command, e.g:
    ``rabbitmqctl list_queues -p my_vhost â€¦``

.. _`rabbitmqctl(1)`: http://www.rabbitmq.com/man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html

.. _monitoring-rmq-queues:

Inspecting queues
-----------------

Finding the number of tasks in a queue:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages messages_ready \
                              messages_unacknowledged


Here `messages_ready` is the number of messages ready
for delivery (sent but not received), `messages_unacknowledged`
is the number of messages that has been received by a worker but
not acknowledged yet (meaning it is in progress, or has been reserved).
`messages` is the sum of ready and unacknowledged messages.


Finding the number of workers currently consuming from a queue:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ rabbitmqctl list_queues name consumers

Finding the amount of memory allocated to a queue:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ rabbitmqctl list_queues name memory

:Tip: Adding the ``-q`` option to `rabbitmqctl(1)`_ makes the output
      easier to parse.


.. _monitoring-redis:

Redis
=====

If you're using Redis as the broker, you can monitor the Celery cluster using
the `redis-cli(1)` command to list lengths of queues.

.. _monitoring-redis-queues:

Inspecting queues
-----------------

Finding the number of tasks in a queue:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ redis-cli -h HOST -p PORT -n DATABASE_NUMBER llen QUEUE_NAME

The default queue is named `celery`. To get all available queues, invoke:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ redis-cli -h HOST -p PORT -n DATABASE_NUMBER keys \*

.. note::

    Queue keys only exists when there are tasks in them, so if a key
    does not exist it simply means there are no messages in that queue.
    This is because in Redis a list with no elements in it is automatically
    removed, and hence it won't show up in the `keys` command output,
    and `llen` for that list returns 0.

    Also, if you're using Redis for other purposes, the
    output of the `keys` command will include unrelated values stored in
    the database.  The recommended way around this is to use a
    dedicated `DATABASE_NUMBER` for Celery, you can also use
    database numbers to separate Celery applications from each other (virtual
    hosts), but this will not affect the monitoring events used by e.g. Flower
    as Redis pub/sub commands are global rather than database based.

.. _monitoring-munin:

Munin
=====

This is a list of known Munin plug-ins that can be useful when
maintaining a Celery cluster.

* rabbitmq-munin: Munin plug-ins for RabbitMQ.

    http://github.com/ask/rabbitmq-munin

* celery_tasks: Monitors the number of times each task type has
  been executed (requires `celerymon`).

    http://exchange.munin-monitoring.org/plugins/celery_tasks-2/details

* celery_task_states: Monitors the number of tasks in each state
  (requires `celerymon`).

    http://exchange.munin-monitoring.org/plugins/celery_tasks/details


.. _monitoring-events:

Events
======

The worker has the ability to send a message whenever some event
happens.  These events are then captured by tools like Flower,
and :program:`celery events` to monitor the cluster.

.. _monitoring-snapshots:

Snapshots
---------

.. versionadded:: 2.1

Even a single worker can produce a huge amount of events, so storing
the history of all events on disk may be very expensive.

A sequence of events describes the cluster state in that time period,
by taking periodic snapshots of this state you can keep all history, but
still only periodically write it to disk.

To take snapshots you need a Camera class, with this you can define
what should happen every time the state is captured;  You can
write it to a database, send it by email or something else entirely.

:program:`celery events` is then used to take snapshots with the camera,
for example if you want to capture state every 2 seconds using the
camera ``myapp.Camera`` you run :program:`celery events` with the following
arguments:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ celery -A proj events -c myapp.Camera --frequency=2.0


.. _monitoring-camera:

Custom Camera
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cameras can be useful if you need to capture events and do something
with those events at an interval.  For real-time event processing
you should use :class:`@events.Receiver` directly, like in
:ref:`event-real-time-example`.

Here is an example camera, dumping the snapshot to screen:

.. code-block:: python

    from pprint import pformat

    from celery.events.snapshot import Polaroid

    class DumpCam(Polaroid):

        def on_shutter(self, state):
            if not state.event_count:
                # No new events since last snapshot.
                return
            print('Workers: {0}'.format(pformat(state.workers, indent=4)))
            print('Tasks: {0}'.format(pformat(state.tasks, indent=4)))
            print('Total: {0.event_count} events, %s {0.task_count}'.format(
                state))

See the API reference for :mod:`celery.events.state` to read more
about state objects.

Now you can use this cam with :program:`celery events` by specifying
it with the :option:`-c` option:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ celery -A proj events -c myapp.DumpCam --frequency=2.0

Or you can use it programmatically like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from celery import Celery
    from myapp import DumpCam

    def main(app, freq=1.0):
        state = app.events.State()
        with app.connection() as connection:
            recv = app.events.Receiver(connection, handlers={'*': state.event})
            with DumpCam(state, freq=freq):
                recv.capture(limit=None, timeout=None)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app = Celery(broker='amqp://guest@localhost//')
        main(app)

.. _event-real-time-example:

Real-time processing
--------------------

To process events in real-time you need the following

- An event consumer (this is the ``Receiver``)

- A set of handlers called when events come in.

    You can have different handlers for each event type,
    or a catch-all handler can be used ('*')

- State (optional)

  :class:`@events.State` is a convenient in-memory representation
  of tasks and workers in the cluster that is updated as events come in.

  It encapsulates solutions for many common things, like checking if a
  worker is still alive (by verifying heartbeats), merging event fields
  together as events come in, making sure timestamps are in sync, and so on.


Combining these you can easily process events in real-time:


.. code-block:: python

    from celery import Celery


    def my_monitor(app):
        state = app.events.State()

        def announce_failed_tasks(event):
            state.event(event)
            # task name is sent only with -received event, and state
            # will keep track of this for us.
            task = state.tasks.get(event['uuid'])

            print('TASK FAILED: %s[%s] %s' % (
                task.name, task.uuid, task.info(), ))

        with app.connection() as connection:
            recv = app.events.Receiver(connection, handlers={
                    'task-failed': announce_failed_tasks,
                    '*': state.event,
            })
            recv.capture(limit=None, timeout=None, wakeup=True)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app = Celery(broker='amqp://guest@localhost//')
        my_monitor(app)

.. note::

    The wakeup argument to ``capture`` sends a signal to all workers
    to force them to send a heartbeat.  This way you can immediately see
    workers when the monitor starts.


You can listen to specific events by specifying the handlers:

.. code-block:: python

    from celery import Celery

    def my_monitor(app):
        state = app.events.State()

        def announce_failed_tasks(event):
            state.event(event)
            # task name is sent only with -received event, and state
            # will keep track of this for us.
            task = state.tasks.get(event['uuid'])

            print('TASK FAILED: %s[%s] %s' % (
                task.name, task.uuid, task.info(), ))

        with app.connection() as connection:
            recv = app.events.Receiver(connection, handlers={
                    'task-failed': announce_failed_tasks,
            })
            recv.capture(limit=None, timeout=None, wakeup=True)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app = Celery(broker='amqp://guest@localhost//')
        my_monitor(app)
