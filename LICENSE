(1) A GPL-compatible license makes it possible to
    combine Celery with other software that is released
    under the GPL, it does not mean that we're distributing
    Celery under the GPL license.  The BSD license, unlike the GPL,
    let you distribute a modified version without making your
    changes open source.
