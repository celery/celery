the 4.x series, please see :ref:`whatsnew-4.3` for
an overview of what's new in Celery 4.3.

4.3.0
=====
:release-date: TBD
:release-by: Omer Katz

- :meth:`celery.chain.apply` does not ignore keyword arguments anymore when
  applying the chain.

  Contributed by **Korijn van Golen**

- Don't attempt to cache results in a :class:`celery.result.ResultSet`.

  During a join, the results cache was populated using :meth:`celery.result.ResultSet.get`, if one of the results
  contains an exception, joining unexpectedly failed.

  The results cache is now removed.

- :meth:`Celery.autodiscover_tasks` now attempts to import the package itself
  when the `related_name` keyword argument is `None`.

  Contributed by **Alex Ioannidis**

- On Windows 10, stale PID files prevented celery beat to run.
  We now remove them when a :class:`SystemExit` is raised.

  Contributed by **:github_user:`na387`**

- Added a new :setting:`task_acks_on_failure_or_timeout`.

  Acknowledging SQS messages on failure or timing out makes it hard to use
  dead letter queues.

  We introduce the new option acks_on_failure_or_timeout,
  to ensure we can totally fallback on native SQS message lifecycle,
  using redeliveries for retries (in case of slow processing or failure)
  and transitions to dead letter queue after defined number of times.

  Contributed by **Mario Kostelac**

- Adjust HA headers to work on RabbitMQ 3.x.

  This change also means we're ending official support for RabbitMQ 2.x.

  Contributed by **Asif Saif Uddin**

- Improve :program:`celery update` error handling.

  Contributed by **Federico Bond**

- Support chords with :setting:`task_always_eager` set to `True`.

  Contributed by **Axel Haustant**

- Optionally store task properties in result backend.

  TODO: Elaborate on this one. https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/4490

  Contributed by **John Arnold**

- Allow the Couchbase result backend to automatically detect serialization format.

  Contributed by **Douglas Rohde**

- Added the Azure Block Blob Storage backend.

  The backend is implemented on top of the azure-storage library which
  uses Azure Blob Storage for a scalable low-cost PaaS backend.

  The backend was load tested via a simple nginx/gunicorn/sanic app hosted
  on a DS4 virtual machine (4 vCores, 16 GB RAM) and was able to handle
  600+ concurrent users at ~170 RPS.

  The commit also contains a live end-to-end test to facilitate
  verification of the backend functionality. The test is activated by
  setting the `AZUREBLOCKBLOB_URL` environment variable to
  `azureblockblob://{ConnectionString}` where the value for
  `ConnectionString` can be found in the `Access Keys` pane of a Storage
  Account resources in the Azure Portal.

- :meth:`celery.app.task.update_state` now accepts keyword arguments.

  This allows passing extra fields to the result backend.

  Contributed by **Christopher Dignam**

- Gracefully handle consumer :class:`kombu.exceptions.DecodeError`.

  TODO: Elaborate about this https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/5044

  Contributed by **Steven Sklar**

- Fix init.d service stop.

  Contributed by **Marcus McHale**

- Drop support for Django < 1.11.

  Contributed by **Asif Saif Uddin**

- Remove old djcelery loader.

  Contributed by **Asif Saif Uddin**

- :class:`celery.worker.request.Request` now passes :class:`celery.app.task.Context`
  to the backend's store_result functions.

  Since the class currently passes `self` to these functions,
  revoking a task resulted in corrupted task result data when
  django-celery-results was used.

  Contributed by **Kiyohiro Yamaguchi**

- Retry if the heartbeat connection dies.

  Previously, we keep trying to write to the broken connection.
  This results in a memory leak because the event dispatcher will keep appending
  the message to the outbound buffer.

  Contributed by **Raf Geens**

- Handle microseconds when scheduling.

  Contributed by **K Davis**

- Fixed deadlock when closing socket.

  TODO: Elaborate about this https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/4997

  Contributed by **Joshua Engelman**

- Correctly consider timezone when calculating timestamp.

  Contributed by **:github_user:`yywing`**

- :meth:`celery.beat.Scheduler.schedules_equal` can now handle either arguments
  being a `None` value.

  Contributed by **:github_user:` ratson`**

- Fixed Sphinx support for shared_task decorated functions.

  Contributed by **Jon Banafato**

- Added the CosmosDB result backend.

  This change adds a new results backend.
  The backend is implemented on top of the pydocumentdb library which uses
  Azure CosmosDB for a scalable, globally replicated, high-performance,
  low-latency and high-throughput PaaS backend.

  Contributed by **Clemens Wolff**

- Added configuration options to seperate multiple apps on single vhost.

  TODO: Elaborate about this https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/5195

  Contributed by **Artem Vasilyev**

- Forget parent meta when forgetting a chain.

  TODO: Elaborate about this https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/5095

  Contributed by **:github_user:`tothegump`**

- Store task arguments inside :class:`celery.exceptions.MaxRetriesExceededError`.

  Contributed by **Anthony Ruhier**

- Added the :setting:`result_accept_content`.

  This feature allows to configure different accepted content for the result
  backend.

  A special serializer (`auth`) is used for signed messaging,
  but the result_serializer remains in json, because we don't want encrypted
  content in our result backend.

  To accept unsigned content from the result backend,
  we introduced this new configuration option to specify the
  accepted content from the backend.

- Fixed error callback processing for class based tasks.

  Contributed by **Victor Mireyev**

- Added support for Cythonized Celery tasks.

  Contributed by **Andrey Skabelin**

- Warn Riak backend users for possible Python 3.7 incompatibilities.

  Contributed by **George Psarakis**

- Added Python 3.7 support.

  Contributed by **Omer Katz** & **Asif Saif Uddin**

- Revamped the auth serializer.

  TODO: Elaborate about this

  Contributed by **Benjamin Pereto**

- :program:`celery report` now reports kernel version along with other
  platform details.

  Contributed by **Omer Katz**

- Fixed chords with chains which include sub chords in a group.

  TODO: Elaborate about this https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/5222

  Contributed by **Maximilien Cuony**

- Complex canvases with error callbacks no longer raises an :class:`AttributeError`.

  TODO: Elaborate about this https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/5297

  Contributed by **Manuel Vázquez Acosta**

- Added proper error messages in cases where app cannot be loaded.

  Previously, celery crashed with an exception.

  We now print a proper error message.

  Contributed by **Omer Katz**

- Added the :setting:`task_default_priority` setting.

  TODO: Elaborate about this https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/5309

  Contributed by **:github_user:`madprogrammer`**

- Bump minimum required version of Kombu to 4.3 and Billiard to 3.6.

  Contributed by **Asif Saif Uddin**

- Fix memory leak.

  TODO: Elaborate about this.
