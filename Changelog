- Python 3: Fixed compatibility issues.

- Windows:  Accidentally showed warning that the billiard C extension

- Django: Tutorial updated with a solution that sets a default

  in with the :program:`celery` command.

    Also fixed typos in the tutorial, and added the settings
    required to use the Django database backend.

    Thanks to Chris Ward, orarbel.
