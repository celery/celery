Important notes
---------------

- Database result backend related setting names changed from
  ``sqlalchemy_*`` -> ``database_*``.

    The ``sqlalchemy_`` named settings won't work at all in this
    version so you need to rename them.  This is a last minute change,
    and as they were not supported in 3.1 we will not be providing
    aliases.

- ``chain(A, B, C)`` now works the same way as ``A | B | C``.

    This means calling ``chain()`` might not actually return a chain,
    it can return a group or any other type depending on how the
    workflow can be optimized.
