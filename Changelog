.. _version-3.1.0:

3.1.0
=====
:state: DEVEL
:branch: master

- `Task.apply_async` now supports timeout and soft_timeout arguments (Issue #802)
- `App.control.Inspect.conf` can be used for inspecting worker configuration

.. _version-3.0.4:

3.0.4
=====
:release-date: 2012-07-26 07:00 P.M BST

- Now depends on Kombu 2.3

- New experimental standalone Celery monitor: Flower

    See :ref:`monitoring-flower` to read more about it!

    Contributed by Mher Movsisyan.

- Now supports AMQP heartbeats if using the new ``pyamqp://`` transport.

    - The py-amqp transport requires the :mod:`amqp` library to be installed::

        $ pip install amqp

    - Then you need to set the transport URL prefix to ``pyamqp://``.

    - The default heartbeat value is 10 seconds, but this can be changed using
      the :setting:`BROKER_HEARTBEAT` setting::

        BROKER_HEARTBEAT = 5.0

    - If the broker heartbeat is set to 10 seconds, the heartbeats will be
      monitored every 5 seconds (double the hertbeat rate).

    See the `Kombu 2.3 changelog`_ for more information.

.. _`Kombu 2.3 changelog`:
    http://kombu.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changelog.html#version-2-3-0

- Now supports RabbitMQ Consumer Cancel Notifications, using the ``pyamqp://``
  transport.

    This is essential when running RabbitMQ in a cluster.

    See the `Kombu 2.3 changelog`_ for more information.

- Delivery info is no longer passed directly through.

    It was discovered that the SQS transport adds objects that can't
    be pickled to the delivery info mapping, so we had to go back
    to using the whitelist again.

    Fixing this bug also means that the SQS transport is now working again.

- The semaphore was not properly released when a task was revoked (Issue #877).

    This could lead to tasks being swallowed and not released until a worker
    restart.

    Thanks to Hynek Schlawack for debugging the issue.

- Retrying a task now also forwards any linked tasks.

    This means that if a task is part of a chain (or linked in some other
    way) and that even if the task is retried, then the next task in the chain
    will be executed when the retry succeeds.

- Chords: Now supports setting the interval and other keyword arguments
  to the chord unlock task.

    - The interval can now be set as part of the chord subtasks kwargs::

        chord(header)(body, interval=10.0)

    - In addition the chord unlock task now honors the Task.default_retry_delay
      option, used when none is specified, which also means that the default
      interval can also be changed using annotations:

        .. code-block:: python

            CELERY_ANNOTATIONS = {
                'celery.chord_unlock': {
                    'default_retry_delay': 10.0,
                }
            }

- New :meth:`@Celery.add_defaults` method can add new default configuration
  dicts to the applications configuration.

    For example::

        config = {'FOO': 10}

        celery.add_defaults(config)

    is the same as ``celery.conf.update(config)`` except that data will not be
    copied, and that it will not be pickled when the worker spawns child
    processes.

    In addition the method accepts a callable::

        def initialize_config():
            # insert heavy stuff that can't be done at import time here.

        celery.add_defaults(initialize_config)

    which means the same as the above except that it will not happen
    until the celery configuration is actually used.

    As an example, Celery can lazily use the configuration of a Flask app::

        flask_app = Flask()
        celery = Celery()
        celery.add_defaults(lambda: flask_app.config)

- Revoked tasks were not marked as revoked in the result backend (Issue #871).

    Fix contributed by Hynek Schlawack.

- Eventloop now properly handles the case when the epoll poller object
  has been closed (Issue #882).

- Fixed syntax error in ``funtests/test_leak.py``

    Fix contributed by Catalin Iacob.

- group/chunks: Now accepts empty task list (Issue #873).

- New method names:

    - ``Celery.default_connection()`` ➠  :meth:`~@Celery.connection_or_acquire`.
    - ``Celery.default_producer()``   ➠  :meth:`~@Celery.producer_or_acquire`.

    The old names still work for backward compatibility.

.. _version-3.0.3:

3.0.3
=====
:release-date: 2012-07-20 09:17 P.M BST
:by: Ask Solem

- amqplib passes the channel object as part of the delivery_info
  and it's not pickleable, so we now remove it.

.. _version-3.0.2:

3.0.2
=====
:release-date: 2012-07-20 04:00 P.M BST
:by: Ask Solem

- A bug caused the following task options to not take defaults from the
   configuration (Issue #867 + Issue #858)

    The following settings were affected:

    - :setting:`CELERY_IGNORE_RESULT`
    - :setting:`CELERYD_SEND_TASK_ERROR_EMAILS`
    - :setting:`CELERY_TRACK_STARTED`
    - :setting:`CElERY_STORE_ERRORS_EVEN_IF_IGNORED`

    Fix contributed by John Watson.

- Task Request: ``delivery_info`` is now passed through as-is (Issue #807).

- The eta argument now supports datetime's with a timezone set (Issue #855).

- The worker's banner displayed the autoscale settings in the wrong order
  (Issue #859).

- Extension commands are now loaded after concurrency is set up
  so that they don't interfere with e.g. eventlet patching.

- Fixed bug in the threaded pool (Issue #863)

- The task failure handler mixed up the fields in :func:`sys.exc_info`.

    Fix contributed by Rinat Shigapov.

- Fixed typos and wording in the docs.

    Fix contributed by Paul McMillan

- New setting: :setting:`CELERY_WORKER_DIRECT`

    If enabled each worker will consume from their own dedicated queue
    which can be used to route tasks to specific workers.

- Fixed several edge case bugs in the add consumer remote control command.

- :mod:`~celery.contrib.migrate`: Can now filter and move tasks to specific
  workers if :setting:`CELERY_WORKER_DIRECT` is enabled.

    Among other improvements, the following functions have been added:

        * ``move_direct(filterfun, **opts)``
        * ``move_direct_by_id(task_id, worker_hostname, **opts)``
        * ``move_direct_by_idmap({task_id: worker_hostname, ...}, **opts)``
        * ``move_direct_by_taskmap({task_name: worker_hostname, ...}, **opts)``

- :meth:`~celery.Celery.default_connection` now accepts a pool argument that
  if set to false causes a new connection to be created instead of acquiring
  one from the pool.

- New signal: :signal:`celeryd_after_setup`.

- Default loader now keeps lowercase attributes from the configuration module.

.. _version-3.0.1:

3.0.1
=====
:release-date: 2012-07-10 06:00 P.M BST
:by: Ask Solem

- Now depends on kombu 2.2.5

- inspect now supports limit argument::

    myapp.control.inspect(limit=1).ping()

- Beat: now works with timezone aware datetime's.

- Task classes inheriting ``from celery import Task``
  mistakingly enabled ``accept_magic_kwargs``.

- Fixed bug in ``inspect scheduled`` (Issue #829).

- Beat: Now resets the schedule to upgrade to UTC.

- The :program:`celery worker` command now works with eventlet/gevent.

    Previously it would not patch the environment early enough.

- The :program:`celery` command now supports extension commands
  using setuptools entry-points.

    Libraries can add additional commands to the :program:`celery`
    command by adding an entry-point like::

        setup(
            entry_points=[
                'celery.commands': [
                    'foo = my.module:Command',
            ],
        ],
        ...)

    The command must then support the interface of
    :class:`celery.bin.base.Command`.

- contrib.migrate: New utilities to move tasks from one queue to another.

    - :func:`~celery.contrib.migrate.move_tasks`
    - :func:`~celery.contrib.migrate.move_task_by_id`

- The task-sent event now contains ``exchange`` and ``routing_key``
  fields.

- Fixes bug with installing on Python 3.

    Fix contributed by Jed Smith.
