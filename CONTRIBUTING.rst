 Contributing
==============

Welcome!

This document is fairly extensive and you aren't really expected
to study this in detail for small contributions;

    The most important rule is that contributing must be easy
    and that the community is friendly and not nitpicking on details,
    such as coding style.

If you're reporting a bug you should read the Reporting bugs section
below to ensure that your bug report contains enough information
to successfully diagnose the issue, and if you're contributing code
you should try to mimic the conventions you see surrounding the code
you're working on, but in the end all patches will be cleaned up by
the person merging the changes so don't worry too much.

Community Code of Conduct
=========================

The goal is to maintain a diverse community that's pleasant for everyone.
That's why we would greatly appreciate it if everyone contributing to and
interacting with the community also followed this Code of Conduct.

The Code of Conduct covers our behavior as members of the community,
in any forum, mailing list, wiki, website, Internet relay chat (IRC), public
meeting or private correspondence.

The Code of Conduct is heavily based on the `Ubuntu Code of Conduct`_, and
the `Pylons Code of Conduct`_.

.. _`Ubuntu Code of Conduct`: https://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct
.. _`Pylons Code of Conduct`: http://docs.pylonshq.com/community/conduct.html

Be considerate
--------------

Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the
work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and
we expect you to take those consequences into account when making decisions.
Even if it's not obvious at the time, our contributions to Celery will impact
the work of others. For example, changes to code, infrastructure, policy,
documentation and translations during a release may negatively impact
others' work.

Be respectful
-------------

The Celery community and its members treat one another with respect. Everyone
can make a valuable contribution to Celery. We may not always agree, but
disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all
experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration
to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community
where people feel uncomfortable or threatened isn't a productive one. We
expect members of the Celery community to be respectful when dealing with
other contributors as well as with people outside the Celery project and with
users of Celery.

Be collaborative
----------------

Collaboration is central to Celery and to the larger free software community.
We should always be open to collaboration. Your work should be done
transparently and patches from Celery should be given back to the community
when they're made, not just when the distribution releases. If you wish
to work on new code for existing upstream projects, at least keep those
projects informed of your ideas and progress. It many not be possible to
get consensus from upstream, or even from your colleagues about the correct
implementation for an idea, so don't feel obliged to have that agreement
before you begin, but at least keep the outside world informed of your work,
and publish your work in a way that allows outsiders to test, discuss, and
contribute to your efforts.

When you disagree, consult others
---------------------------------

Disagreements, both political and technical, happen all the time and
the Celery community is no exception. It's important that we resolve
disagreements and differing views constructively and with the help of the
community and community process. If you really want to go a different
way, then we encourage you to make a derivative distribution or alternate
set of packages that still build on the work we've done to utilize as common
of a core as possible.

When you're unsure, ask for help
--------------------------------

Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect. Asking
questions avoids many problems down the road, and so questions are
encouraged. Those who are asked questions should be responsive and helpful.
However, when asking a question, care must be taken to do so in an appropriate
forum.

Step down considerately
-----------------------

Developers on every project come and go and Celery is no different. When you
leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do
so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should
tell people you're leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others
can pick up where you left off.

Other bugs
----------

Bugs can always be described to the :ref:`mailing-list`, but the best
way to report an issue and to ensure a timely response is to use the
issue tracker.

1) **Create a GitHub account**.

You need to `create a GitHub account`_ to be able to create new issues
and participate in the discussion.

.. _`create a GitHub account`: https://github.com/signup/free

2) **Determine if your bug is really a bug**.

You shouldn't file a bug if you're requesting support. For that you can use
the :ref:`mailing-list`, or :ref:`irc-channel`. If you still need support
you can open a github issue, please prepend the title with ``[QUESTION]``.

3) **Make sure your bug hasn't already been reported**.

Search through the appropriate Issue tracker. If a bug like yours was found,
check if you have new information that could be reported to help
the developers fix the bug.

4) **Check if you're using the latest version**.

A bug could be fixed by some other improvements and fixes - it might not have an
existing report in the bug tracker. Make sure you're using the latest releases of
celery, billiard, kombu, amqp, and vine.

5) **Collect information about the bug**.

To have the best chance of having a bug fixed, we need to be able to easily
reproduce the conditions that caused it. Most of the time this information
will be from a Python traceback message, though some bugs might be in design,
spelling or other errors on the website/docs/code.

    A) If the error is from a Python traceback, include it in the bug report.

    B) We also need to know what platform you're running (Windows, macOS, Linux,
       etc.), the version of your Python interpreter, and the version of Celery,
       and related packages that you were running when the bug occurred.

    C) If you're reporting a race condition or a deadlock, tracebacks can be
       hard to get or might not be that useful. Try to inspect the process to
       get more diagnostic data. Some ideas:

       * Enable Celery's :ref:`breakpoint signal <breakpoint_signal>` and use it
         to inspect the process's state. This will allow you to open a
         :mod:`pdb` session.
       * Collect tracing data using `strace`_(Linux),
         :command:`dtruss` (macOS), and :command:`ktrace` (BSD),
         `ltrace`_, and `lsof`_.

    D) Include the output from the :command:`celery report` command:

        .. code-block:: console

            $ celery -A proj report

        This will also include your configuration settings and it will try to
        remove values for keys known to be sensitive, but make sure you also
        verify the information before submitting so that it doesn't contain
        confidential information like API tokens and authentication
        credentials.

    E) Your issue might be tagged as `Needs Test Case`. A test case represents
       all the details needed to reproduce what your issue is reporting.
       A test case can be some minimal code that reproduces the issue or
       detailed instructions and configuration values that reproduces
       said issue.

6) **Submit the bug**.

By default `GitHub`_ will email you to let you know when new comments have
been made on your bug. In the event you've turned this feature off, you
should check back on occasion to ensure you don't miss any questions a
developer trying to fix the bug might ask.

Issue Trackers
--------------

Bugs for a package in the Celery ecosystem should be reported to the relevant
issue tracker.

* :pypi:`celery`: https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/
* :pypi:`kombu`: https://github.com/celery/kombu/issues
* :pypi:`amqp`: https://github.com/celery/py-amqp/issues
* :pypi:`vine`: https://github.com/celery/vine/issues
* :pypi:`librabbitmq`: https://github.com/celery/librabbitmq/issues
* :pypi:`django-celery-beat`: https://github.com/celery/django-celery-beat/issues
* :pypi:`django-celery-results`: https://github.com/celery/django-celery-results/issues

If you're unsure of the origin of the bug you can ask the
:ref:`mailing-list`, or just use the Celery issue tracker.

Contributors guide to the code base
===================================

There's a separate section for internal details,
including details about the code base and a style guide.

Read :ref:`internals-guide` for more!

.. _versions:

Versions
========

Version numbers consists of a major version, minor version and a release number.
Since version 2.1.0 we use the versioning semantics described by
SemVer: http://semver.org.

Stable releases are published at PyPI
while development releases are only available in the GitHub git repository as tags.
All version tags starts with “v”, so version 0.8.0 has the tag v0.8.0.

.. _git-branches:

Branches
========

Current active version branches:

* dev (which git calls "master") (https://github.com/celery/celery/tree/master)
* 4.2 (https://github.com/celery/celery/tree/4.2)
* 4.1 (https://github.com/celery/celery/tree/4.1)
* 3.1 (https://github.com/celery/celery/tree/3.1)

You can see the state of any branch by looking at the Changelog:

    https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/master/Changelog

If the branch is in active development the topmost version info should
contain meta-data like:

.. code-block:: restructuredtext

    4.3.0
    ======
    :release-date: TBA
    :status: DEVELOPMENT
    :branch: dev (git calls this master)

The ``status`` field can be one of:

* ``PLANNING``

    The branch is currently experimental and in the planning stage.

* ``DEVELOPMENT``

    The branch is in active development, but the test suite should
    be passing and the product should be working and possible for users to test.

* ``FROZEN``

    The branch is frozen, and no more features will be accepted.
    When a branch is frozen the focus is on testing the version as much
    as possible before it is released.

dev branch
----------

The dev branch (called "master" by git), is where development of the next
version happens.

Maintenance branches
--------------------

Maintenance branches are named after the version -- for example,
the maintenance branch for the 2.2.x series is named ``2.2``.

Previously these were named ``releaseXX-maint``.

The versions we currently maintain is:

* 4.2
 
  This is the current series.

* 4.1

  Drop support for python 2.6. Add support for python 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.

* 3.1

  Official support for python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3, and also supported on PyPy.

Archived branches
-----------------

Archived branches are kept for preserving history only,
and theoretically someone could provide patches for these if they depend
on a series that's no longer officially supported.

An archived version is named ``X.Y-archived``.

To maintain a cleaner history and drop compatibility to continue improving
the project, we **do not have any archived version** right now.

Feature branches
----------------

Major new features are worked on in dedicated branches.
There's no strict naming requirement for these branches.

Feature branches are removed once they've been merged into a release branch.

Tags
====

- Tags are used exclusively for tagging releases. A release tag is
  named with the format ``vX.Y.Z`` -- for example ``v2.3.1``.

- Experimental releases contain an additional identifier ``vX.Y.Z-id`` --
  for example ``v3.0.0-rc1``.

- Experimental tags may be removed after the official release.

.. _contributing-changes:

Working on Features & Patches
=============================

.. note::

    Contributing to Celery should be as simple as possible,
    so none of these steps should be considered mandatory.

    You can even send in patches by email if that's your preferred
    work method. We won't like you any less, any contribution you make
    is always appreciated!

    However, following these steps may make maintainer's life easier,
    and may mean that your changes will be accepted sooner.

Forking and setting up the repository
-------------------------------------

First you need to fork the Celery repository; a good introduction to this
is in the GitHub Guide: `Fork a Repo`_.

After you have cloned the repository, you should checkout your copy
to a directory on your machine:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git@github.com:username/celery.git

When the repository is cloned, enter the directory to set up easy access
to upstream changes:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd celery
    $ git remote add upstream git://github.com/celery/celery.git
    $ git fetch upstream

If you need to pull in new changes from upstream you should
always use the ``--rebase`` option to ``git pull``:

.. code-block:: console

    git pull --rebase upstream master

With this option, you don't clutter the history with merging
commit notes. See `Rebasing merge commits in git`_.
If you want to learn more about rebasing, see the `Rebase`_
section in the GitHub guides.

If you need to work on a different branch than the one git calls ``master``, you can
fetch and checkout a remote branch like this::

    git checkout --track -b 5.0-devel upstream/5.0-devel

**Note:** Any feature or fix branch should be created from ``upstream/master``.

.. _`Rebase`: https://help.github.com/rebase/

.. _contributing-docker-development:

Developing and Testing with Docker
----------------------------------

Because of the many components of Celery, such as a broker and backend,
`Docker`_ and `docker-compose`_ can be utilized to greatly simplify the
development and testing cycle. The Docker configuration here requires a
Docker version of at least 17.13.0 and `docker-compose` 1.13.0+.

The Docker components can be found within the :file:`docker/` folder and the
Docker image can be built via:

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker-compose build celery

and run via:

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker-compose run --rm celery <command>

where <command> is a command to execute in a Docker container. The `--rm` flag
indicates that the container should be removed after it is exited and is useful
to prevent accumulation of unwanted containers.

Some useful commands to run:

* ``bash``

    To enter the Docker container like a normal shell

* ``make test``

    To run the test suite.
    **Note:** This will run tests using python 3.8 by default.

* ``tox``

    To run tox and test against a variety of configurations.
    **Note:** This command will run tests for every environment defined in :file:`tox.ini`.
    It takes a while.

* ``pyenv exec python{2.7,3.5,3.6,3.7,3.8} -m pytest t/unit``

    To run unit tests using pytest.

    **Note:** ``{2.7,3.5,3.6,3.7,3.8}`` means you can use any of those options.
    e.g. ``pyenv exec python3.6 -m pytest t/unit``

* ``pyenv exec python{2.7,3.5,3.6,3.7,3.8} -m pytest t/integration``

    To run integration tests using pytest

    **Note:** ``{2.7,3.5,3.6,3.7,3.8}`` means you can use any of those options.
    e.g. ``pyenv exec python3.6 -m pytest t/unit``

By default, docker-compose will mount the Celery and test folders in the Docker
container, allowing code changes and testing to be immediately visible inside
the Docker container. Environment variables, such as the broker and backend to
use are also defined in the :file:`docker/docker-compose.yml` file.

By running ``docker-compose build celery`` an image will be created with the
name ``celery/celery:dev``. This docker image has every dependency needed
for development installed. ``pyenv`` is used to install multiple python
versions, the docker image offers python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.
The default python version is set to 3.8.

The :file:`docker-compose.yml` file defines the necessary environment variables
to run integration tests. The ``celery`` service also mounts the codebase
and sets the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable to ``/home/developer/celery``.
By setting ``PYTHONPATH`` the service allows to use the mounted codebase
as global module for development. If you prefer, you can also run
``python -m pip install -e .`` to install the codebase in development mode.

If you would like to run a Django or stand alone project to manually test or
debug a feature, you can use the image built by `docker-compose` and mount
your custom code. Here's an example:

Assuming a folder structure such as:

.. code-block:: console

    + celery_project
      + celery # repository cloned here.
      + my_project 
        - manage.py
        + my_project
          - views.py

.. code-block:: yaml

   version: "3"

   services:
       celery:
           image: celery/celery:dev
           environment:
               TEST_BROKER: amqp://rabbit:5672
               TEST_BACKEND: redis://redis
            volumes:
                - ../../celery:/home/developer/celery
                - ../my_project:/home/developer/my_project
            depends_on:
                - rabbit
                - redis
        rabbit:
            image: rabbitmq:latest
        redis:
            image: redis:latest

In the previous example, we are using the image that we can build from
this repository and mounting the celery code base as well as our custom
project.

.. _contributing-testing:

Running the unit test suite
---------------------------

If you like to develop using virtual environments or just outside docker,
you must make sure all necessary dependencies are installed.
There are multiple requirements files to make it easier to install all dependencies.
You do not have to use every requirements file but you must use `default.txt`.

.. code-block:: console

   # pip install -U -r requirements/default.txt

To run the Celery test suite you need to install
:file:`requirements/test.txt`.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -U -r requirements/test.txt
    $ pip install -U -r requirements/default.txt

After installing the dependencies required, you can now execute
the test suite by calling :pypi:`py.test <pytest>`:

.. code-block:: console

    $ py.test t/unit
    $ py.test t/integration

Some useful options to :command:`py.test` are:

* ``-x``

    Stop running the tests at the first test that fails.

* ``-s``

    Don't capture output

* ``-v``

    Run with verbose output.

If you want to run the tests for a single test file only
you can do so like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ py.test t/unit/worker/test_worker.py

.. _contributing-coverage:

Calculating test coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To calculate test coverage you must first install the :pypi:`pytest-cov` module.

Installing the :pypi:`pytest-cov` module:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -U pytest-cov

Code coverage in HTML format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Run :command:`py.test` with the ``--cov-report=html`` argument enabled:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ py.test --cov=celery --cov-report=html

#. The coverage output will then be located in the :file:`htmlcov/` directory:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ open htmlcov/index.html

Code coverage in XML (Cobertura-style)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Run :command:`py.test` with the ``--cov-report=xml`` argument enabled:

.. code-block:: console

    $ py.test --cov=celery --cov-report=xml

#. The coverage XML output will then be located in the :file:`coverage.xml` file.

.. _contributing-tox:

Running the tests on all supported Python versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There's a :pypi:`tox` configuration file in the top directory of the
distribution.

To run the tests for all supported Python versions simply execute:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox

Use the ``tox -e`` option if you only want to test specific Python versions:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox -e 2.7

Building the documentation
--------------------------

To build the documentation, you need to install the dependencies
listed in :file:`requirements/docs.txt` and :file:`requirements/default.txt`:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -U -r requirements/docs.txt
    $ pip install -U -r requirements/default.txt

Additionally, to build with no warnings, you will need to install
the following packages:

.. code-block:: console

   $ apt-get install texlive texlive-latex-extra dvipng

After these dependencies are installed, you should be able to
build the docs by running:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd docs
    $ rm -rf _build
    $ make html

Make sure there are no errors or warnings in the build output.
After building succeeds, the documentation is available at :file:`_build/html`.

.. _contributing-verify:

Verifying your contribution
---------------------------

To use these tools, you need to install a few dependencies. These dependencies
can be found in :file:`requirements/pkgutils.txt`.

Installing the dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -U -r requirements/pkgutils.txt

pyflakes & PEP-8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure that your changes conform to :pep:`8` and to run pyflakes
execute:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make flakecheck

To not return a negative exit code when this command fails, use
the ``flakes`` target instead:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make flakes

API reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make sure that all modules have a corresponding section in the API
reference, please execute:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make apicheck

If files are missing, you can add them by copying an existing reference file.

If the module is internal, it should be part of the internal reference
located in :file:`docs/internals/reference/`. If the module is public,
it should be located in :file:`docs/reference/`.

For example, if reference is missing for the module ``celery.worker.awesome``
and this module is considered part of the public API, use the following steps:


Use an existing file as a template:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd docs/reference/
    $ cp celery.schedules.rst celery.worker.awesome.rst

Edit the file using your favorite editor:

.. code-block:: console

    $ vim celery.worker.awesome.rst

        # change every occurrence of ``celery.schedules`` to
        # ``celery.worker.awesome``


Edit the index using your favorite editor:

.. code-block:: console

    $ vim index.rst

        # Add ``celery.worker.awesome`` to the index.


Commit your changes:

.. code-block:: console

Isort
~~~~~~

`Isort`_ is a python utility to help sort imports alphabetically and separated into sections.
The Celery project uses isort to better maintain imports on every module.
Please run isort if there are any new modules or the imports on an existent module
had to be modified.

.. code-block:: console

   $ isort my_module.py # Run isort for one file
   $ isort -rc . # Run it recursively
   $ isort m_module.py --diff # Do a dry-run to see the proposed changes

.. _contributing-pull-requets:

Creating pull requests
----------------------

When your feature/bugfix is complete, you may want to submit
a pull request, so that it can be reviewed by the maintainers.

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure you go through this checklist to
make it easier for the maintainers to accept your proposed changes:

- [ ] Make sure any change or new feature has a unit and/or integration test.
      If a test is not written, a label will be assigned to your PR with the name
      ``Needs Test Coverage``.

- [ ] Make sure unit test coverage does not decrease.
      ``py.test -xv --cov=celery --cov-report=xml --cov-report term``.
      You can check the current test coverage here: https://codecov.io/gh/celery/celery

- [ ] Run ``flake8`` against the code. The following commands are valid
      and equivalent.:

      .. code-block:: console

          $ flake8 -j 2 celery/ t/
          $ make flakecheck
          $ tox -e flake8

- [ ] Run ``flakeplus`` against the code. The following commands are valid
      and equivalent.:

      .. code-block:: console

          $ flakeplus --2.7 celery/ t/
          $ make flakes
          $ tox -e flakeplus

- [ ] Run ``pydocstyle`` against the code. The following commands are valid
      and equivalent.:

      .. code-block:: console

          $ pydocstyle celery/
          $ tox -e pydocstyle

- [ ]  Build api docs to make sure everything is OK. The following commands are valid
      and equivalent.:

      .. code-block:: console

          $ make apicheck
          $ cd docs && sphinx-build -b apicheck -d _build/doctrees . _build/apicheck
          $ tox -e apicheck

- [ ] Build configcheck. The following commands are valid
      and equivalent.:

      .. code-block:: console

          $ make configcheck
          $ cd docs && sphinx-build -b configcheck -d _build/doctrees   . _build/configcheck
          $ tox -e configcheck

- [ ] Run ``bandit`` to make sure there's no security issues. The following commands are valid
      and equivalent.:

      .. code-block:: console

          $ pip install -U bandit
          $ bandit -b bandit.json celery/
          $ tox -e bandit

- [ ] Run unit and integration tests for every python version. The following commands are valid
      and equivalent.:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ tox -v

- [ ] Confirm ``isort`` on any new or modified imports:

      .. code-block:: console

        $ isort my_module.py --diff

Creating pull requests is easy, and they also let you track the progress
of your contribution. Read the `Pull Requests`_ section in the GitHub
Guide to learn how this is done.

You can also attach pull requests to existing issues by following
the steps outlined here: https://bit.ly/koJoso

You can also use `hub`_ to create pull requests. Example: https://theiconic.tech/git-hub-fbe2e13ef4d1

.. _`hub`: https://hub.github.com/

Status Labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are `different labels`_ used to easily manage github issues and PRs.
Most of these labels make it easy to categorize each issue with important
details. For instance, you might see a ``Component:canvas`` label on an issue or PR.
The ``Component:canvas`` label means the issue or PR corresponds to the canvas functionality.
These labels are set by the maintainers and for the most part external contributors
should not worry about them. A subset of these labels are prepended with **Status:**.
Usually the **Status:** labels show important actions which the issue or PR needs.
Here is a summary of such statuses:

- **Status: Cannot Reproduce**

  One or more Celery core team member has not been able to reproduce the issue.

- **Status: Confirmed**

  The issue or PR has been confirmed by one or more Celery core team member.

- **Status: Duplicate**

  A duplicate issue or PR.

- **Status: Feedback Needed**

  One or more Celery core team member has asked for feedback on the issue or PR.

- **Status: Has Testcase**

  It has been confirmed the issue or PR includes a test case.
  This is particularly important to correctly write tests for any new
  feature or bug fix.

- **Status: In Progress**

  The PR is still in progress.

- **Status: Invalid**

  The issue reported or the PR is not valid for the project.

- **Status: Needs Documentation**

  The PR does not contain documentation for the feature or bug fix proposed.

- **Status: Needs Rebase**

  The PR has not been rebased with ``master``. It is very important to rebase
  PRs before they can be merged to ``master`` to solve any merge conflicts.

- **Status: Needs Test Coverage**

  Celery uses `codecov`_ to verify code coverage. Please make sure PRs do not
  decrease code coverage. This label will identify PRs which need code coverage.

- **Status: Needs Test Case**

  The issue or PR needs a test case. A test case can be a minimal code snippet
  that reproduces an issue or a detailed set of instructions and configuration values
  that reproduces the issue reported. If possible a test case can be submitted in
  the form of a PR to Celery's integration suite. The test case will be marked
  as failed until the bug is fixed. When a test case cannot be run by Celery's
  integration suite, then it's better to describe in the issue itself.

- **Status: Needs Verification**

  This label is used to notify other users we need to verify the test case offered
  by the reporter and/or we need to include the test in our integration suite.

- **Status: Not a Bug**

  It has been decided the issue reported is not a bug.

- **Status: Won't Fix**

  It has been decided the issue will not be fixed. Sadly the Celery project does
  not have unlimited resources and sometimes this decision has to be made.
  Although, any external contributors are invited to help out even if an
  issue or PR is labeled as ``Status: Won't Fix``.

- **Status: Works For Me**

  One or more Celery core team members have confirmed the issue reported works
  for them.

.. _coding-style:

Coding Style
============

You should probably be able to pick up the coding style
from surrounding code, but it is a good idea to be aware of the
following conventions.

* All Python code must follow the :pep:`8` guidelines.

:pypi:`pep8` is a utility you can use to verify that your code
is following the conventions.

* Docstrings must follow the :pep:`257` conventions, and use the following
  style.

    Do this:

    .. code-block:: python

        def method(self, arg):
            """Short description.

            More details.

            """

    or:

    .. code-block:: python

        def method(self, arg):
            """Short description."""


    but not this:

    .. code-block:: python

        def method(self, arg):
            """
            Short description.
            """

* Lines shouldn't exceed 78 columns.

  You can enforce this in :command:`vim` by setting the ``textwidth`` option:

  .. code-block:: vim

        set textwidth=78

  If adhering to this limit makes the code less readable, you have one more
  character to go on. This means 78 is a soft limit, and 79 is the hard
  limit :)

* Import order

    * Python standard library (`import xxx`)
    * Python standard library (`from xxx import`)
    * Third-party packages.
    * Other modules from the current package.

    or in case of code using Django:

    * Python standard library (`import xxx`)
    * Python standard library (`from xxx import`)
    * Third-party packages.
    * Django packages.
    * Other modules from the current package.

    Within these sections the imports should be sorted by module name.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        import threading
        import time

        from collections import deque
        from Queue import Queue, Empty

        from .platforms import Pidfile
        from .five import zip_longest, items, range
        from .utils.time import maybe_timedelta

* Wild-card imports must not be used (`from xxx import *`).

* For distributions where Python 2.5 is the oldest support version,
  additional rules apply:

    * Absolute imports must be enabled at the top of every module::

        from __future__ import absolute_import

    * If the module uses the :keyword:`with` statement and must be compatible
      with Python 2.5 (celery isn't), then it must also enable that::

        from __future__ import with_statement

    * Every future import must be on its own line, as older Python 2.5
      releases didn't support importing multiple features on the
      same future import line::

        # Good
        from __future__ import absolute_import
        from __future__ import with_statement

        # Bad
        from __future__ import absolute_import, with_statement

     (Note that this rule doesn't apply if the package doesn't include
     support for Python 2.5)


* Note that we use "new-style" relative imports when the distribution
  doesn't support Python versions below 2.5

    This requires Python 2.5 or later:

    .. code-block:: python

        from . import submodule


.. _feature-with-extras:

Contributing features requiring additional libraries
====================================================

Some features like a new result backend may require additional libraries
that the user must install.

We use setuptools `extra_requires` for this, and all new optional features
that require third-party libraries must be added.

1) Add a new requirements file in `requirements/extras`

    For the Cassandra backend this is
    :file:`requirements/extras/cassandra.txt`, and the file looks like this:

    .. code-block:: text

        pycassa

    These are pip requirement files, so you can have version specifiers and
    multiple packages are separated by newline. A more complex example could
    be:

    .. code-block:: text

        # pycassa 2.0 breaks Foo
        pycassa>=1.0,<2.0
        thrift

2) Modify ``setup.py``

    After the requirements file is added, you need to add it as an option
    to :file:`setup.py` in the ``extras_require`` section::

        extra['extras_require'] = {
            # ...
            'cassandra': extras('cassandra.txt'),
        }

3) Document the new feature in :file:`docs/includes/installation.txt`

    You must add your feature to the list in the :ref:`bundles` section
    of :file:`docs/includes/installation.txt`.

    After you've made changes to this file, you need to render
    the distro :file:`README` file:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ pip install -U requirements/pkgutils.txt
        $ make readme


That's all that needs to be done, but remember that if your feature
adds additional configuration options, then these needs to be documented
in :file:`docs/configuration.rst`. Also, all settings need to be added to the
:file:`celery/app/defaults.py` module.

Result backends require a separate section in the :file:`docs/configuration.rst`
file.

.. _contact_information:

Contacts
========

This is a list of people that can be contacted for questions
regarding the official git repositories, PyPI packages

.. _release-procedure:


Release Procedure
=================

Updating the version number
---------------------------

The version number must be updated in three places:

    * :file:`celery/__init__.py`
    * :file:`docs/include/introduction.txt`
    * :file:`README.rst`

The changes to the previous files can be handled with the [`bumpversion` command line tool]
(https://pypi.org/project/bumpversion/). The corresponding configuration lives in
:file:`.bumpversion.cfg`. To do the necessary changes, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ bumpversion

After you have changed these files, you must render
the :file:`README` files. There's a script to convert sphinx syntax
to generic reStructured Text syntax, and the make target `readme`
does this for you:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make readme

Now commit the changes:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git commit -a -m "Bumps version to X.Y.Z"

and make a new version tag:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git tag vX.Y.Z
    $ git push --tags

Releasing
---------

Commands to make a new public stable release:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make distcheck  # checks pep8, autodoc index, runs tests and more
    $ make dist  # NOTE: Runs git clean -xdf and removes files not in the repo.
    $ python setup.py sdist upload --sign --identity='Celery Security Team'
    $ python setup.py bdist_wheel upload --sign --identity='Celery Security Team'

If this is a new release series then you also need to do the
following:

* Go to the Read The Docs management interface at:
    https://readthedocs.org/projects/celery/?fromdocs=celery

* Enter "Edit project"

    Change default branch to the branch of this series, for example, use
    the ``2.4`` branch for the 2.4 series.

* Also add the previous version under the "versions" tab.
